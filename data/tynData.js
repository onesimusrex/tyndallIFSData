01 11 00 Summary of Work
General Introductory Information: Sustainability and Resiliency
With the exception of individual building projects required to pursue certification proving compliance with
the federally mandated Guiding Principles (refer to A-GRAM 17-01 February 2017 for more information),
Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) will not pursue third-party certification associated with site or building
projects. As previously mentioned, however, criteria from other leading sustainability- and resiliencyfocused
rating systems will be incorporated as appropriate. Nearly every section of the existing Tyndall

Sustainability Leadership and Management
Project teams are better able to serve the community when led and managed by people and
organizations that have a strong commitment to the principles of sustainability and resiliency and have
demonstrated the ability to effectively incorporate these principles into projects.
All projects must have an individual dedicated to enforcing and tracking sustainability and resiliency
requirements. That individual should have at least 5 years of S+R experience applicable to the project
type. Depending on the project type and scope, one individual may serve as the S+R coordinator; for
larger or more complex projects, multiple individuals may be needed. The individual should guide the
project team through the design and construction phases, interfacing with the construction team’s S+R
coordinator to ensure compliance and continuity. The individual should also work with the Tyndall AFB
project manager throughout the life of the project to ensure full compliance and accountability.
Project Process
A Sustainability and Resiliency Management Plan (SRMP) enables a project to set goals, objectives, and
policies; instigate plans and programs; review performance against a plan; and take corrective actions
across the full dimensions of sustainability. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
14004 standard for social and environmental management plans provides guidance on developing a
Sustainability Management Plan. SRMPs should include design and construction and should allow for
continued operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project for aspects that extend past project turnover.
SRMPs may be stand-alone or incorporated into larger management plans. For smaller projects,
sustainability management policies may be sufficient. The SRMP must manage the scope, scale, and
complexity of the project’s S+R goals and describe how each must be met. The assessment is based on
the organizational policies, authorities, mechanisms, education, and business processes put in place
along with a determination of sufficiency.
The SRMP must have the minimum following components:
• Organizational charts and documentation showing the personnel responsible for project S+R issues,
their position in the project organization, and their authority to make project decisions and affect
change.
• An index of all project features related to sustainability and resiliency and all aspects that require
tracking, reporting, or other documentation.
• Assessment of the project’s environmental, economic, and social impacts. This may include the
potential for existing, non-sustainable conditions to further deteriorate environmental, economic, or
social conditions if left unaddressed.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
6 04 October 2019
• Prioritized list of project goals, objectives, and performance targets that consider project importance
and the consequences of change. Goals should be aligned to objectives and targets that meet
community needs and issues.
• Documentation of a robust plan-do-check-act methodology to identify priorities, evaluate progress,
and make adjustments to continually improve project S+R performance.
• Identification of potential areas where changes in key design variables may impact future project
performance related to S+R. Include evidence that the SRMP accounts for these potential changes
and is adaptable.
• Documentation of how the S+R requirements will be communicated to the Design Team and verified
with the Tyndall AFB project manager.
• Documentation that regular monitoring and reporting of progress against the SRMP’s goals and
objectives is occurring throughout the design phase (for example, meetings or written reports).
• Plans for how the S+R requirements will be communicated and transitioned from the design phase to
the construction phase through methods such as construction plans, daily job briefings, subcontractor
orientations, or onsite field training sessions.
To create the SRMP, the S+R coordinator must develop a list of all the environmental, economic, and
social aspects of the project that relate to sustainability and resiliency. Once established, the list of
aspects is prioritized by the project team based on the importance of meeting project requirements. There
may be some variations depending on the project size, type, and complexity. The SRMP must have clear
processes and controls in place to achieve the requirements (that is, the SRMP is not solely aspirational
in nature). Implementation of the SRMP must be revisited throughout the design phase and should be
updated as needed and submitted as part of each major milestone submittal to Tyndall AFB. The SRMP
should recognize that changes in socioeconomic and environmental conditions have the potential to
significantly impact projects. SRMPs and their subsequent performance goals take these changing
conditions into account.
Starting in pre-design, but no later than the start of the conceptual design phase, the project’s S+R
coordinator must develop the initial SRMP document. The SRMP should encompass all aspects related
to the design phase of the project and should also plan for the integration of the contractor. At the start of
the construction phase, the SRMP should be transferred to the contractor where it must then update the
content with how the construction team intends to assimilate the SRMP components and execute all
requirements. The contractor should provide the updated version to the Design Team’s S+R Coordinator
and to the Tyndall AFB project manager. The contractor’s coordinator must provide regular updates to the
same individuals throughout the construction phase, as well as a final version including end results of all
initiatives to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record.

01 33 29 Sustainability Reporting
Provide documentation for Guiding Principles Validation for all buildings. Horizontal infrastructure does
not require third party certification, but still must provide relevant sustainability documentation as listed in
01 61 00 Common Product Requirements. Additional Sustainability Requirements for the program include
mandated reporting on Sustainability, Resilience and Smart Technology Key Performance Indicators.
01 35 00 Special Procedures
Projects at Tyndall AFB can exceed minimum regulatory requirements and improve health and safety on
the project site, surrounding areas, and broader communities. Project teams cannot always eliminate
risks to health and safety, but can demonstrate that both the benefits and exposure to risks associated
with the project are not disproportionately burdened for one group of users over another. Having and
promoting a common focus on health and safety throughout the construction industry has benefits that
extend beyond the individual project.
Since projects teams governed by this IFS update may encounter requirements that may not be present
in typical criteria, project teams should conduct hazard analyses and develop construction safety plans to
address risks associated with using new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies. The components
of these requirements address safety procedures for onsite workers, personnel training and development,
and site and information security. These themes not only protect the individuals working on the site, they
help to maintain safe and secure operations of the asset and provide a foundation for proper O&M of the
facility.
Design Team – Vertical Projects
Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to
achieve safety and health synergies across disciplines and across two key building life-cycle stages
described below. Use the analyses to inform the Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR), basis of design
(BOD), design documents, and construction documents.
Perform safety design reviews before the completion of schematic design to explore how the completed
building will be operated and maintained over its expected lifetime. Use a life-cycle safety approach to
explore how to reduce hazards and improve efficiency and well-being for building O&M personnel.
Assess each of the following systems where applicable:
• Roof Systems. Assess how personnel will access the roof for operations, inspection, and
maintenance; the distance of equipment and feature locations (including some types of cool roofs,
vegetated roofs, and solar panel installations) to roof edge; equipment installation and replacement
access (including point loading); water and power access for vegetated roofs; and the need for
installation of fall protection measures.
• Equipment Rooms and Systems. Assess how personnel will access equipment and controls
needing servicing; any work at height or in confined spaces; need for sufficient clearances to
electrical or other equipment; equipment installation and replacement access; chemical storage
needs; and fall protection, eye wash, or other safety feature needs.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
8 04 October 2019
• Building Exterior Enclosure and Daylighting Systems. Assess how personnel will clean exterior
(e.g. cladding including windows and exterior shading devices) skylights and interior atria features.
• Storage and Collection of Recyclables. Assess the need for O&M workers to manually handle
recyclables. Assess measures needed for handling of hazardous waste streams that could contain
batteries, sharp edges, mercury-containing lamps, or similar items.
• Special Features. If applicable, assess rainwater management cisterns, energy recovery wheels, or
geothermal wells for confined space hazards. Assess access, confined space, and fall exposures for
underfloor air distribution systems.
Document how the reviews led to incorporating at least one protective measure for each system into
design and building feature decisions in the project’s OPR and BOD, including the following, as
applicable:
• Building roof designs (for example, use of parapets, guard rails, setbacks, fall protection)
• Equipment room and recyclable storage area design and layout
• Exterior enclosure, daylighting, and special feature designs
• Safe O&M plans for submittal to Owner, including recommendations where applicable for use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as foot, head, eye and face, ear, respiratory, and fall
protection
Have a construction safety specialist perform safety constructability reviews before the completion of
schematic design to explore and plan how safety and efficiency can be optimized during construction. If
feasible, engage a general contractor and key trade contractors and suppliers improves planning and
allows consideration of options such as prefabrication and modularization that can improve construction
employee safety, construction efficiency, and downstream maintenance efficiency and safety. Assess the
following topic areas where applicable:
• Site Conditions. Assess site hazards such as presence of overhead power lines or brownfieldrelated
soil exposures relevant to foundation work.
• Building Reuse. Assess potential hazards arising out of reuse, ranging from structural safety and
deconstruction safety to the presence of hazardous materials such as lead, asbestos, or mold.
• Construction Activity Pollution Prevention. Assess how the Pollution Prevention Plan can be used
to further reduce exposures to construction employees. For example, use local exhaust ventilated
tools and/or wet method controls on all outdoor dust-generating tools and equipment to reduce
exposures from silica, welding, and other construction contaminants at the source.
• Construction Indoor Air Quality Management. Assess how the Indoor Air Quality Management
Plan can be used to further reduce exposures to construction employees. For example, use local
exhaust ventilated tools and/or wet method controls on all indoor dust-generating tools and
equipment to reduce exposures from silica, welding, and other construction contaminants at the
source.
• Waste Recycling Management. Assess construction worker handling of construction wastes, and
incorporate measures (for example, the use of motorized equipment) to minimize potential for manual
handling injuries into waste management plans.
• Materials and Resources. Assess the utility of low-emitting materials, material ingredient reporting,
chemical of concern avoidance, and source reduction approaches to further reduce construction
worker exposures.
• Working at Heights. Assess and minimize the need for working at heights. Where appropriate, use
permanent fall prevention features developed during O&M safety design review. Plan for general
contractors to employ 100% fall protection during the construction phase.
• Special Features. If applicable, assess construction safety and sequence issues (for example, fall
hazards, and confined space hazards) related to vegetated and cool roofs, installation of solar panels,
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 9
rainwater management cisterns, energy recovery wheels, or geothermal wells, underfloor air
distribution systems, or other special features.
Document how the above reviews led to incorporating at least one protective measure strategy for each
of the applicable topic areas above into the project’s design and construction documents, such as those
listed below:
• Construction plan describing key construction stages
• Building and temporary structure designs
• Construction Project Safety Plan (PSP) describing safety expectations, roles, procedures, and goals,
including recommendations, where applicable, for use of PPE, such as foot, head, eye, ear,
respiratory, and fall protection
• Construction Activity Pollution Prevention Plan
• Construction Indoor Air Quality Management Plan (describe additional worker safety measures)
• Construction and Demolition Waste Management Plan (describe additional worker safety measures)
Compile the above documentation into an organized format and provide to the Tyndall AFB project
manager for record.
Construction Team – All Projects
The contractor must designate a Safety Officer accountable for safety performance on the project
construction site. This individual must maintain a professional credential in construction worksite safety
granted by an independent third‐party safety authority or accreditation program. The Safety Officer must
document all reportable injuries and illnesses on the Occupational Health and Safety Administration
(OSHA) Form 300, scoped specifically to include reportable information for the project only. The OSHA
300 form can be accessed here: osha.gov/recordkeeping/new‐osha300form1‐1‐04.pdf.
Project Safety Plan
The contractor’s Safety Officer and management team members must develop a Project Safety Plan
(PSP) representative of the entire duration of the project and includes the following minimum
components:
• Documentation that the Owner and contractor have a site-specific safety plan and a PSP. This plan
may include, but is not limited to, contractor background checks on personnel working on the project,
and 24-hour security monitoring on the project (physical/electronic). The security plan should be
appropriate to the size and scope of the project.
For small projects (less than $5 million in cost), Owners and contractors may substitute general site
security policies for the site-specific plan.
A short narrative that describes the goals of the PSP and how the PSP will be implemented and used
to manage safety on the project. Include documentation showing the Owner and contractors
developed a proactive investigative process that focuses on root-cause and corrective actions rather
than disciplinary actions and financial penalties.
• A list or table of all major construction operations occurring within the work zone, including dates and
locations of each operation.
– Documentation of safety and/or security competency training programs, either online or in person,
for field personnel, including type of training provided and how they specifically target health and
safety. Training may include task-specific safety training or general awareness training.
– Documentation of minimum training requirements for health and safety programs, such as
occupational safety and health, first aid, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, emergency response,
and active shooter training.
• A description of the sequence for each operation.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
10 04 October 2019
• A list or table that identifies all potential hazards associated with each step in the sequence of each
operation.
• A list of preventive actions for each potential hazard.
• A list of any individuals or parties responsible for implementing preventive actions.
– Include documentation showing contractors developed program requirements to ensure
subcontractors maintain a high level of safety per the contract.
– Include documentation showing Owners and contractors have an incident review process that
involves all levels of management to validate corrective measures to minimize future injuries and
incidents on the job site.
• Documentation that contractors develop “lessons learned” reports that allow other contractors and
projects the opportunity to review the fact-finding of an incident and implement processes and
procedures to minimize similar incidents on the job site.
• A description of miscellaneous or additional hazards that may be present within or adjacent to the
work zone and an appropriate means of abatement or prevention.
Record any changes to the PSP throughout the construction process with an explanatory narrative
describing circumstances, if necessary. Compile the above documentation into an organized format and
provide to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record at the completion of construction.
01 50 00 Temporary Construction Facilities and Controls
Construction projects at Tyndall AFB must reduce and prevent disturbances to surrounding environments
and communities due to construction activities. Such efforts must address noise, vibration, light, and
glare. All projects impact their surrounding environments; however, infrastructure projects are usually
long-term projects that may take years to complete construction. During this time, it is important for the
project to have minimal negative impacts on the surrounding community.
The contractor must therefore establish, implement, and maintain a formal Construction Impact Mitigation
Plan (CIMP) during construction for the prime contractor. The CIMP must be in place at the beginning of
construction activities and cover all project activities, including subcontractor work.
The CIMP must address, at minimum, the following construction impacts together as one plan or as
separate plans: noise, vibration, light, glare, and other activities anticipated to create nuisance or
disturbance to surrounding communities.
For each type of impact:
• Identify the responsible party for mitigation activities, their contact information, their responsibilities,
and their qualifications. Include information if any portions of the CIMP were prepared by an outside
party.
• Identify the location and distance to the closest receptors for noise, vibration, light, and glare.
• Describe the surrounding zoning and parcel information (for example, commercial, residential,
hospitals, schools, parks, and sensitive habitat).
• List proposed construction activities (for example, demolition, excavation, paving, bridge foundations,
and finishing).
• Identify dates and working hours of proposed construction activities.
• List noise‐, vibration‐, light‐, glare‐ or other nuisance‐generating devices used during construction.
• List mitigating devices and reduction strategies used during each construction activity, including:
– For noise and vibration, specifically, specifications for minimizing construction noise and vibration
should meet or exceed accepted local practices.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 11
– PPE requirements for all site employees.
– A map showing the locations of any installed controls (include mitigating devices or strategies for
construction phase activities only).
• Identify procedures for inspection and maintenance of preventive measures and site controls.
• Include permit numbers and agency or local authority policies associated with construction work, as
applicable.
• Describe monitoring standards, methods, and acceptable levels.
• Describe corrective procedures for non‐compliance. Document feedback mechanisms in place for
receiving and responding to public and stakeholder concerns during construction. The construction
contractor is expected to work with affected neighbors to develop construction plans as well as
monitoring and corrective action programs.
• Outline expected staff training needs.
• Include the signature of the responsible party or parties.
Record any modifications to the CIMP and provide supporting evidence of the monitoring activities that
occur throughout construction. Maintain changes to the CIMP in the document so the reader can see the
evolution of the CIMP throughout the project. The contractor must submit a final CIMP to the Tyndall AFB
project manager for record.
01 57 23 Temporary Stormwater Pollution Control
Comply with Construction General Permit(CGP) requirements. Coordinate sequencing of work, use of
common soil stockpile areas, and construction stormwater pollution best management practices (BMPs)
with the PMO to accommodate work of other contractors.
Tyndall AFB projects have a responsibility to protect receiving waters (including surface water,
groundwater, and stormwater systems), air quality, and public safety by preventing and minimizing the
discharge of construction site pollutants and materials. This is especially true of the water aspects, given
the immediate adjacency to coastal and wetland areas.
Requirements
For all projects, the Design Team must create and implement an Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollutant
Control Plan, commonly referred to as a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) or Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Plan (ESCP) for all construction activities associated with the project. Regardless
of project size, the plan (SWPPP or ESCP) must conform to erosion and sedimentation requirements of
the most current version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Construction General Permit
or local erosion and sedimentation control standards and codes, whichever is more stringent.
The SWPPP or ESC must list the BMPs employed and describe how the BMPs accomplish the following
objectives:
• Prevent loss of soil during construction by stormwater runoff or wind erosion, including protecting
topsoil by stockpiling or covering for reuse.
• Prevent and reduce sediment discharges into storm conveyances, receiving waters, or other public
infrastructure components or systems.
• Prevent polluting the air with dust and particulate matter.
• Prevent runoff and infiltration of other pollutants from construction sites (for example, thermal
pollution, concrete wash, fuels, solvents, hazardous chemical runoff, high or low pH discharges, and
pavement sealants) and ensure proper disposal of all construction-related materials.
• Protect any Vegetation and Soil Protection Zones (VSPZs) and other areas of vegetation that will
remain onsite during construction activities.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
12 04 October 2019
Note: The construction phase of the project is considered complete when the site is stabilized, a notice of
termination is filed, or a notice of substantial completion is issued.
The CGP outlines the provisions necessary to comply with Phase I and Phase II of the EPA National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program (or local equivalent for projects outside the
United States). Although the CGP applies only to sites greater than one acre (0.40 hectare), its
requirements are applied to all Tyndall AFB projects.
Recommended Strategies
Employ strategies such as a combination of temporary and permanent seeding, mulching, earth dikes,
sediment traps, sediment basins, filter socks, compost berms and blankets, secondary containment, spill
control equipment, hazardous waste manifests, and overfill alarms. Include the following aspects, as
appropriate to each project type:
• Erosion and sedimentation control
– Providing natural buffers
– Installing perimeter controls
– Minimizing sediment track-out
– Controlling discharges from stockpiled sediment or soil
– Minimizing dust
– Minimizing the disturbance of steep slopes
– Preserving topsoil
– Minimizing soil compaction
– Protecting storm drain inlets
 Maintaining control measures
o Stabilization
 Deadlines for initiating and completing stabilization
 Criteria for stabilization
o Pollution prevention
 Prohibited discharges
 General maintenance requirements
 Pollution prevention standards
 Emergency spill notification
 Fertilizer discharge restrictions
• Implement post-construction stormwater management with construction
sequencing (such as infiltration systems constructed or rehabilitated at the end of
the project); account for weather conditions during construction activities to
minimize unintended chemical dispersal or other adverse effects on and offsite
(such as apply pavement sealers and perform mass-grading operations only
when no rain is predicted)
The contractor must establish control measures before construction begins and implement additional
measures as needed based on site conditions and as construction progresses. The establishment and
maintenance of ESCP measures are generally the responsibility of the general contractor or builder. At a
minimum, the contractor must provide regular inspections and documentation updates to show progress.
If any issues arise, the issue must be documented along with what remedial measures were implemented
to alleviate the issue.
• Monitor control measures periodically through site inspections and record maintenance activities
taken during construction.
• Inspections must be recorded regularly via date-stamped photographs, inspection reports, or other
recording processes.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 13
The following actions are also recommended:
• Any problems identified in site inspections should be resolved in a timely manner.
• All subcontractors should promptly notify the responsible party if they see damage to an ESCP
measure.
• Generate and save documentation as the SWPPP or ESC is implemented for compilation in the final
report.
Submittal Documentation
The Design Team must provide the following to the S+R Coordinator, and these must be a component of
the final construction documents:
• The SWPPP, ESCP, or other local required plan (whichever is more stringent). If a local standard has
been followed, provide documentation to demonstrate the local standard is equal to or more stringent
than the referenced NPDES program.
• Site plan showing the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite.
The contractor must provide the following construction-related content:
• Key pollution prevention personnel and their responsibilities and qualifications
• Schedule of activities for construction operations
• A list of expected pollutants generated by construction operations
• Relevant regulatory compliance information, including minimum effluent and air quality standards
• Identification of buffers and potentially impacted bodies of water
• Narrative describing the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite
– For zero lot line projects and projects with minimal or no exterior work: Description of special
conditions and compliance with any applicable ESCP measures
• Video or photos that document the erosion and sedimentation control measures implemented onsite
• Video or photos that document any issues that arise, as well as documentation showing their
corrective actions; include information regarding the timeframe between initial offense and correction
Final SWPPP/ESCP documentation must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record.
01 61 00 Common Product Requirements
Requirements listed herein apply to materials and products that will be used on all project types under the
guidance of the IFS. Design Teams must follow the criteria below in the identification of qualifying
components for inclusion in final full design specifications and project drawings. Designers must
communicate these requirements as well as requirements to track material and product data to project
contractors. This section enables projects to exceed the minimum requirements set forth in various
Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) that include sustainable and resilient product attributes, including those
from UFC 1-200-02.
All Projects
All project types must develop a Material and Product Plan. The Material and Product Plan must be
developed by the Design Team and communicated to the construction team, who will be responsible for
implementation. The Design Team must identify a pool of qualifying materials and products so as not to
sole source and violate Federal project procurement regulations. The Material and Product Plan must
contain tracking mechanisms developed by the Design Team as appropriate to each project. The
mechanisms must be provided to the contractor for use throughout construction. At project completion,
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
14 04 October 2019
the tracking information—including supporting vendor/manufacturer product information—must be
provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record.
Reduce Net Embodied Carbon
Project teams must strive to reduce embodied carbon associated with each project type; plans for
implementation must be included in the Material and Product Plan. This approach combines concepts of
sourcing local materials, using materials more efficiently, and using lower-impact materials in order to
reduce the combined environmental impacts of material use. In the required calculations, carbon is used
as a proxy unit of measure to compare various impacts across the entire supply chain of material
consumption. One stage of this supply chain involves raw material extraction/harvesting, refinement, and
manufacturing into products. The second involves transportation of the materials from the manufacturer to
their final destination onsite. By designing projects to use less material, use material efficiently, or
specifying materials with lower embodied carbon, as well as reducing transportation distances, project
teams can reduce the overall impact of the project.
Availability of data on the carbon intensity of materials is often limited, and some projects may involve
hundreds or thousands of products. Therefore, acceptable documentation may take a streamlined
approach for conducting calculations for this requirement. Project teams may identify a select list of
primary materials/products that collectively make up greater than 80% of the total embodied carbon. If
data on embodied carbon or material intensity is not available from the manufacturer, project teams may
use averages or generalized data from studies or material databases. Project teams should track,
document, and clearly explain their methodology for calculating material intensity. The resulting narrative
must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager for record.
Transportation of materials to project sites can be a significant contributor to the embodied carbon of
materials. Local or regional materials—even materials sourced or processed onsite—reduce the impact of
long transport and support local economies. It is important to note that while it is generally desirable to
use locally sourced materials for the aforementioned reasons, use of local materials could have negative
impacts on performance if those materials result in reduced durability, safety, or service life. Carbon
emissions associated with the transportation of materials to the project site are specifically broken out as
they are often simpler to calculate based on distance; quantity; and standard truck, air, rail, or shipping
fuel consumption. Carbon emissions are also calculated separately to show the possible conflicts that
exist of sourcing a lower-intensity material from farther away. Project teams should consider choices that
reduce the overall net embodied carbon of materials.
Documentation must include the following:
• Determination of materials that are the primary contributors to embodied carbon for the project during
construction and operation.
– Documentation of the primary materials to be used in the construction and ongoing operation of
the project over its life. Documentation should include:
 The materials used.
 General estimates of the quantities of materials used.
Note that operations materials may need to be multiplied by the frequency of use over the
project life. Material estimates should include anticipated repairs/upkeep (for example, road
resurfacing).
 Estimates of the embodied carbon of materials.
Estimates may use readily available public information such as regional, national, or global
averages.
– Identification of the select materials that collectively will make up more than 80% of the total
estimated embodied carbon of the project.
• Calculations of the primary contributors to overall embodied carbon and an index of the embodied
carbon calculations of the primary contributors to carbon intensity over the life of the project
(construction and operations). This should include:
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 15
– Carbon emissions to produce the material, including raw material extraction, refinement, and
manufacture including secondary or tertiary processing.
– Carbon emissions from transporting the material from the manufacturer to the project site,
including intermediary points.
– Embodied carbon data may come from the manufacturer, reputable databases, reputable
embodied energy software, or from project team calculations. If the source or specific type of
materials is not known at the time of assessment, calculations may present a range of values or
rely on likely material choices. Calculations should be in tons carbon dioxide (CO2).
• Narrative explaining the project’s reduction of the net embodied carbon of materials used in
construction and operation.
– Documentation that the project has set targets for reducing net embodied carbon.
– Documentation of strategies/plans to reduce net embodied carbon. These may include, but are
not limited to:
 Sizing the project to require less material.
 Designing the project to use less material.
 Choosing materials that have lower embodied carbon.
 Reducing material needed for repair and maintenance.
 Reducing material waste during construction.
 Reducing material waste during operation.
 Sourcing local materials to reduce transportation emissions.
 Using lower-carbon transportation modes.
– Calculations of reductions in embodied carbon achieved. Calculations should compare total
carbon intensity of materials for the project against the total carbon intensity of the baseline.
Calculations should be in tons CO2.
Horizontal Projects
Use Recycled Materials
Using recycled, reused, and renewable materials and products—including existing structures and
materials onsite—reduces demand for virgin materials and the embodied carbon emissions and
environmental degradation attributed to their extraction and processing. Using these materials also
reduces waste and supports the market for recycled and reused materials. Horizontal projects must use a
minimum of 40% (by weight, volume, or cost) of recycled materials including materials with recycled
content and/or reused existing structures or materials per individual project scope. Projects that lack
applicable scope to meet this requirement must provide a narrative indicating justification to their
Tyndall AFB project manager for consideration. Include descriptive narrative and tracking mechanisms in
the Material and Product Plan.
Suggested Strategies
Reduce the amount of new pavement materials needed through soil stabilization methods to reduce the
required thickness of a new pavement or processes that incorporate existing pavement structures into
new pavement structures. The area treated is calculated based on the entire area of existing preserved or
reconstructed pavement materials.
Soil stabilization methods may include the use of geosynthetics (geogrids and fabrics) to reduce the
thickness of aggregate required for stabilization of subgrade; the use of geosynthetics to reduce the
thickness of aggregate above the geosynthetics that would have been required for structural support
when subgrade soils are susceptible to pumping and base course intrusion; the use of Portland cement
and/or cementitious by‐product materials for soil stabilization for pavement construction, if it can be
demonstrated that this process will reduce the use of natural aggregate (virgin aggregate or material
hauled from off‐site source) use for stabilization; other chemical stabilization; and fractured slab
techniques, including crack‐and‐seat, and rubblization.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
16 04 October 2019
Use recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) or recycled concrete aggregate (RAP or RCA) in new pavement
lifts or granular base course or embankments. The recycled materials can originate from the project or
other areas at Tyndall AFB or surrounding areas, and be recycled onsite or offsite.
Average recycled content (ARC) must be calculated per the following calculation:
Where: ARC (%) = (Σ rn / Σ Wn) x 100%
– rn = the total weight or volume of RAP or RCA
– Wn = the total weight or volume of either all existing pavement materials or all bedding, backfill,
and granular embankment materials per the method of recycling used
– n = the number of materials considered in accordance with the method used
Recycle pavement materials in place using cold‐in‐place recycling, hot‐in‐place recycling, and full depth
reclamation methods.
Reuse the subbase granular material of existing pavement elements as subgrade embankment or as part
of the new subbase during construction of the proposed new pavement structure.
Relocate and reuse at least 90% of the minor structural elements that meet current code, including
existing luminaires, signal poles, and sign structures required to be removed and/or relocated onsite or by
the agency.
Calculations of recycled materials can be done by weight, volume, or cost, but must remain consistent
throughout the project. Calculations should compare the total quantity of recycled materials and reused
structures with the total quantity of materials on the project. Products that contain a percentage of
recycled material should be factored according to the percentage of material that is recycled.
Recycled content is defined in accordance with ISO 14021 as the portion of materials used in a product
that have been diverted from the solid waste stream and used in part or whole in place of a new primary
material. Material eligible for consideration can also be defined as pre-existing material onsite, or from
another site, that was previously a product or piece of equipment that is now being repurposed or reused.
To track contributing materials and efforts, project teams must coordinate between designers and
contractors to generate the following documentation for submission to the Tyndall AFB project manager:
• Total quantity of materials used on the project by weight, volume, or cost.
• Inventory of specifications for materials containing recycled content. Inventory should include the
name of the product, the name of the manufacturer, the weight, volume, or cost of the material, and
the percentage of recycled content (either post-industrial or post-consumer recycled content).
• Calculations of percentage of reused or recycled materials by weight, volume, or cost. To calculate
materials with recycled content, multiply the material weight, volume, or cost by the percentage of
recycled content. Mechanical, electrical, water equipment, and their components may be excluded
from the calculations. In these instances, the most efficient equipment should be specified.
Calculations do not include plants, soils, rocks, or water.
• Inventory of existing materials or structures that have been reused. Design documents showing the
location and weight, volume, or cost of reused structures or materials. In determining weight, volume,
or cost, the project team may refer to standard equivalents. The project team must be able to
demonstrate an intentional choice to salvage materials or structures that might otherwise have been
sent to landfills and/or replaced. Provide a narrative to accompany the above required calculations.

01 74 19 Construction Waste Management and Disposal
Waste management services vary widely from one location to another; therefore, teams should begin by
identifying the technologies, haulers, and facilities reasonably available in the Tyndall area. Planning for
construction waste management (CWM) before construction allows time to identify the most effective
waste diversion strategies available. Such strategies typically include reuse, recycling, donation, and
salvage; however, source reduction and source separation are also viable and effective. Source reduction
eliminates project waste through prefabrication, modular construction, or incorporating standard material
lengths or sizes into construction documents. Source separation sorts waste onsite into recycling
streams, ensuring delivery to the correct facility. Retaining construction and demolition materials onsite
reduces the cost of disposal at a landfill. Rather than viewing them as “waste,” using construction and
demolition materials as resources for new site development reduces the need for and costs associated
with purchasing new materials such as wood, concrete and other types of masonry, and drywall.
All projects must develop and implement a Construction and Demolition Waste Management Plan
(CDWMP). The CDWMP must account for all materials, including land-clearing debris, materials to be
used for alternative daily cover (ADC), and other materials not contributing to diversion but not included in
the diverted waste total. Material sent to landfills for use as cover is still being disposed of in landfills and
therefore does not meet the intent of this effort. The safe removal and disposal of hazardous materials
must also be covered in the CDWMP. Hazardous materials must be tracked separately and not be
included in the project’s total waste.
• Horizontal projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 50% of structural materials, and
75% of road and infrastructure materials.
• Vertical projects must pursue an overall diversion rate of at least 85%, attained through any
combination of strategies appropriate to the project type and scope.
Diversion rate = (Total waste diverted from landfill / Total waste produced by project) × 100
• Establish waste diversion goals for the project by identifying at least five materials (both structural and
nonstructural) targeted for diversion. Approximate a percentage of the overall project waste that these
materials represent.
– It may be easiest to focus on determining the heaviest waste or the waste that generates the
most volume.
– For Horizontal projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include materials
composted onsite or sent to a composting facility, the use of material, if appropriate, as infill,
Portland cement concrete, and ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
 Non-composted and non-organic materials should not be added to soil as an amendment
unless these materials can be demonstrated to benefit site soils and planned vegetation.
– For Vertical projects, common materials that may be simple to divert include drywall, acoustical
ceiling tiles, carpet and other flooring, wood, scrap metals, brick, and concrete.
 Finish materials, such as flooring and ceiling tiles, can often be recycled through the major
manufacturers via take-back programs.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 21
 Consider incorporating reuse of finish materials, furniture, or framing into the design early.
Reusing existing materials may require design modifications. Some materials must remain
intact to be reused (for example, drywall) or may require additional preparation (for example,
de-nailing).
– Source reduction strategies should be incorporated into the design of the project and outlined in
the CWM plan. These strategies include modular construction, reduced packaging, using
industry-standard measurements, and prefabrication.
• Specify whether materials will be separated or commingled at the project site and describe the
diversion strategies planned for the project. Describe where the material will be taken and how the
recycling facility will process the material.
– Projects may use a combination of onsite separation and commingled collection, depending on
what is appropriate for the project location, material stream, and available facilities and haulers.
 For onsite separation, common CWM strategies include donation, resale, onsite reuse,
recycling, or refurbishment. Crushing asphalt, concrete, and masonry for infill or aggregate is
also considered onsite waste diversion.
 The most common offsite strategies are incineration, combustion of wood, and sending
commingled waste to a sorting facility. Include wood waste converted to fuel (biofuel) in the
calculations; other types of waste-to-energy are not considered diversion for this effort.
– Establish onsite infrastructure, practices, and policies for offsite sorting, and develop a tracking
system.
• Track all the construction and demolition waste leaving the site. Retain waste hauler reports for
documentation. Record estimated weight or volume of materials reused onsite or salvaged for reuse
on other projects by subcontractors or vendors.
• Retain receipts and estimate weight or volume for materials donated to charities, reuse retailers, or
other recipients that can verify and track incoming and outgoing materials.
At project construction completion, the construction team must provide a final, revised report detailing all
major waste streams generated, including disposal and diversion rates, and all backup documentation,
i.e. hauling receipts and monthly summaries from the hauler.
01 80 00 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS
Energy Performance
Comply with Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10 Part 433” Energy Efficiency Standards for New
Federal Commercial and Multi-Family High-Rise Residential Buildings’ Baseline Standards” (Update 6
Nov 2015). Commercial buildings must be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are 30%
less than the consumption levels of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 baseline building.
New buildings and major renovations of existing buildings are to reduce fossil fuel-generated energy
consumption 80% in FY 2020, 90% in FY 2025, and 100% in FY 2030, compared to a FY 2003 baseline.
Federal low-rise residential buildings must be designed and constructed in compliance with the
International Code Council 2015 International Energy Conservation Code.
Install metering and advanced metering devices in accordance with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
Metering Guidance, November 2014, or subsequent updates.
Achieving Best-In-Class energy performance is required and should include the following components:
• Reduced operating costs through reduced energy consumption
• Enhanced resilience through reduced requirements for energy and water
• Enhanced resilience through passive survivability
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
22 04 October 2019
• Downsizing of emergency generator and fuel storage equipment
• Better and more durable buildings
• Improved occupant comfort and productivity
• Significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions
• Simplification of powering buildings with renewable energy and energy storage
• Mitigation of the risk of future energy cost volatility
• Reduced maintenance burden
• Mitigation of the risk of future climate changes such as greater peak cooling loads
Tyndall AFB is in Climate Zone 2A, and it is cooling dominated. ASHRAE research and publications
indicate that a target Energy Use Intensity at Tyndall AFB can be 22 thousand British thermal units per
square foot (kBtu/ft2) per year, site energy, for a typical office building. Allowances can be made for the
type of building, hours of operation, and USAF-driven process loads, but this is where best-in-class
energy performance starts, and it is the baseline for energy performance.
This level of energy performance is to be achieved through the use of integrated design strategies where
all design, construction and operations personnel think of the building as a system, not as individual
components. Interdisciplinary solutions must be identified that result in savings that dwarf componentbased
efficiencies. Well thought-out, cost-effective, simple-to-maintain strategies must result in the
downsizing of HVAC equipment, artificial lighting, and electrical systems to provide low energy
performance with a conventional budget. Energy modeling must be initiated early in the process, and the
model must be continually updated as design options are considered and selected.
In summary, the approach to achieving a low-energy-consuming building starts with the building
envelope, where the interior environment is separated from the exterior. Buildings will include high “R”
value, thermally broken, well air-sealed assemblies to minimize the skin load. Hygro-thermal analysis
should be included to identify condensation and mold issues as well. Next, the internal loads created by
USAF equipment must be as efficient as possible to minimize the energy requirements. Efficient heating,
cooling, ventilation, and lighting are to be provided only where needed, when needed, and rarely for
unoccupied spaces. Equipment to provide heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting must be highefficiency
type, and ventilation requirements should be separated from sensible heating and cooling.
In Tyndall AFB’s climate zone, the cooling load can be expected to represent two thirds of a building’s
energy consumption. Efforts to reduce the cooling loads must include the following:
• Attention to orientation and massing. An east-west orientation significantly contributes to avoiding
unwanted solar gain while providing opportunities for effective daylighting strategies that reduce the
need for artificial lighting.
• A window-to-wall ratio maximum of 30% with reduced glazing on the east and west facades
compared to the north and south facades. Glazing must be well placed for daylighting and views.
• Appropriate shading of fenestration to prevent solar gain and glare.
• High R-value opaque wall assemblies.
• Continuous exterior insulation to create a thermal break. This includes slabs and foundations, as well
as roofs and wall assemblies. Pay attention to balconies, parapets, and similar.
• Incorporating cool roofs.
• A continuous air barrier throughout all six sides of the building. The air barrier must be tested in
accordance with ASTM E779, and the infiltration must not exceed 0.15 cubic foot per minute per
square foot (cfm/ft2) of envelope at 75 Pascals (Pa).
• The lighting power density must be no more than 0.4 watt per square foot (ft2) for the overall building;
for individual areas, the wattage per square foot must match the criteria as defined in ASHRAE/
Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) Standard 90.1. Lighting controls, to include occupancy
sensors, photocell control, daylight harvesting, bilevel dimming, and similar, must minimize power
consumption and eliminate lighting of unoccupied spaces. Use task lighting with vacancy sensors to
supplement low ambient light levels.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 23
• Equipment and appliances must be ENERGY STAR rated, and careful attention must be paid to the
reduction of plug loads through the optimization of office equipment, copy rooms, vending and
kitchenettes.
HVAC systems will vary based on building type and size. They must be right sized to avoid inefficient
operation at part load, and they must be high-efficiency systems. The fact that a high-performance air
barrier and envelope is required gives the HVAC system designer the confidence needed to downsize
systems. Where possible, ventilation requirements must be decoupled from sensible heating
requirements, and energy recovery ventilation must be used. Demand controlled ventilation must be used
where appropriate, such as in often unoccupied assembly areas. Focus should be placed on simplifying
systems and downsizing equipment through load reduction. An effort to minimize the maintenance
requirements must be included through the use of simple strategies such as heat pipes for heat recovery.
Economizers and free cooling must be used when possible.
Service water heating loads must be minimized through water conservation. Plumbing fixtures must be
Water Sense labelled with particular attention paid to fixtures using hot water. Compact plumbing plans
must be provided where possible, and efficient service water heating equipment must be specified.
01 81 10 Sustainable and Resilient Design Requirements
Summary
The requirements delineated herein and throughout the Divisions encompass those applicable to both
S+R at Tyndall AFB and are applicable to all project types. These criteria exceed the requirements of the
following sections in the Pre-Final IFS:
• B.02.3
• C01.1
• C04.1
• C06.1.4
• D.02
• D03.2
• E.01
Project Certification
A standard requirement of all DoD building projects is to comply with UFC 1-200-02, High Performance
and Sustainable Building (HPSB) Requirements for Building Design and Construction. Similarly,
UFC 3-201-01 and UFC 3-210-10 address the horizontal project aspects of vegetation design and
stormwater control; these criteria collectively contribute to projects’ required adherence with the Guiding
Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings. All qualifying USAF projects that meet the thresholds for
required third-party certification as explained in UFC 1-200-02 are additionally required to pursue Guiding
Principles certification through either the Green Building Initiative or the Green Business Certification Inc.
programs. The requirements contained within this appendix do not interfere with a project’s ability to meet
the minimum requirements of either the UFC or the third-party certification program; rather, the guidelines
enhance projects’ resiliency and sustainability from a holistic approach and exceed nearly every minimum
requirement for typical DoD projects.
Within this section are requirements that apply to overall project design and do not necessarily lend
themselves well to incorporation in individual Divisions. They represent holistic approaches rather than
individual design components. Designers will see some specific mentions within other Divisions, however,
when specific design features may be required that merit more detailed description in context of other
products and materials.
Integrative Process (Exceeds UFC 1-200-02)
Integrative Process is a requirement of the Guiding Principles for vertical projects; this Tyndall AFBspecific
Appendix, however, requires the design strategy for all project types.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
24 04 October 2019
Review the Integrative Process (IP) ANSI Consensus National Standard Guide© 2.0 for Design and
Construction of Sustainable Buildings and Communities, which provides step-by-step guidance and a
methodology for improving building design, construction, and operations through a replicable, integrative
process. Also review ASHRAE 189.1 Informative Appendix F (Integrated Design) in accordance with the
requirements of UFC 1-200-02.
Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to
achieve synergies across disciplines and building systems. Use the analyses described below to inform
the OPR, BOD, design documents, and construction documents.
• Form a diverse team of qualified professionals as early as possible.
– Team members must coordinate with one another throughout the life of the project. For optimal
interaction and communication, ensure the project team has multiple face-to-face meetings.
– The integrative Design Team should include, at minimum, the following roles:
 Owner and/or client
 Professionals knowledgeable in design, construction, and maintenance
 Professionals knowledgeable in sustainable and resilient practices
 Professionals with expertise in vegetation, water, soils, landscape ecology, materials, and
human health and well-being, selected to meet the unique constraints and opportunities of
the project and its site
– Identify project stakeholders and full range of potential site user groups and list the primary and
secondary user groups
– All members of the project team must provide the following documentation:
 Name of each team member and his or her expertise (for example, vegetation, hydrology,
soil, landscape ecology, materials, and human health)
 Role on the project
 If an individual fulfills more than one role on the project, explain how he or she has the
various skill sets or expertise for each
• Develop a collaborative communication process:
– Develop an agreed-upon communication method for team members, which should be
collaborative and allow the viewpoints and perspectives of all members to be fully considered in
the decision-making process
– Designate a team facilitator to be responsible for overseeing and ensuring a collaborative
communication process
– Develop a narrative describing the collaborative communication process:
 List of team members responsible for facilitating collaborative communication
 Signatures from all team members who participated in the collaborative communication
process
 Attach meeting minutes from all team meetings
• Identify project S+R principles and performance goals:
– Identify the principles and performance goals of the project (both short- and long- term) and
include an associated timeline and specific performance measures for each goal to determine
when it has been achieved
– Designate specific team members to track project goals throughout the development process:
 Identify project stakeholders
 Identify the full range of potential site users; list the primary and secondary user groups
• Incorporate the S+R principles and performance goals into a program:
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 25
– Develop a program plan that at minimum includes the following information:
 The unique characteristics, opportunities, and constraints of the site
 General project parameters, such as the scope, budget, implementation schedule, purpose,
and design intent of the project
 A diagram or description of the intended function, arrangement, and relationship of desired
features and their approximate dimensions
– For all project types, perform a preliminary resiliency analysis before the completion of schematic
design that identifies potential physical and procedural actions that can be taken by the project to
prepare for and mitigate short- and long-term hazards to the building, occupants, physical
property, and physical infrastructure. System diversity and redundancy should be considered and
accounted for in the approach. There is preference for ecologically based resiliency approaches
over a hardened infrastructure approach. Explore shock-resistant planning and design for
extreme weather events/heat waves along with ongoing adaptation to increasing ambient
temperatures, sea level rise and flood intensity, water security, energy security, transportation
access, and local self-reliance. Planning and design interventions should result in complementary
systems and technics that have low demands for and/or produce water and energy, while
supporting biodiversity that offers stabilizing levels of redundancy/back-up, local/regional selfreliance
and development capacity, and shock resistance and recovery potential.
 The study must consider damage impacts within the immediate project boundary and
relevant surrounding areas along with the disruption of essential services that may become
unavailable including, but not limited to electricity, water, sewer, security and fire department
services. Opportunities for cooperative action with surrounding facilities or base-wide
systems must be identified as a means of mitigation. Those opportunities will vary depending
on the project location.
 Safe and resilient issues reflecting site, local, regional hazards and opportunities may
include, but are not limited to: extreme weather and rain, flooding, storm surge, extreme wind,
discordant behavior or physical conflict, and exposure to hazardous materials.
 For all projects:
o Identify opportunities for cooperative behavior, collaboration and coordination to improve
resilience and provide the socio-economic means for problem-solving.
o Identify technical opportunities that can be used to improve resilience and provide
physical tools for problem-solving.
 Document how the above analysis informed design and form decisions in the project’s OPR
and BOD and the eventual design of the project.
– For all project types, perform a preliminary water budget analysis before the completion of
schematic design that explores how to reduce potable water loads in the building and/or on the
site, and accomplish related S+R goals. Assess and estimate the project’s potential non-potable
water supply sources and water demand volumes, including the following:
 Indoor water demand: assess flow and flush fixture design case demand volumes.
 Outdoor water demand: assess landscape irrigation design case demand volume.
 Process water demand: assess kitchen, laundry, cooling tower, and other equipment
demand volumes, as applicable.
 Supply sources: assess all potential non-potable water supply source volumes, such as
onsite rainwater and graywater, municipally supplied nonpotable water, and HVAC equipment
condensate.
– Document how the above analysis informed building and site design decisions in the project’s
OPR and BOD. Demonstrate how at least one onsite non-potable water supply source was used
to reduce the burden on municipal supply or wastewater treatment systems by contributing to at
least two of the water demand components listed above. Demonstrate how the analysis informed
the design of the project, including the following, as applicable:
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
26 04 October 2019
 Plumbing systems
 Sewage conveyance and/or onsite treatment systems
 Rainwater quantity and quality management systems
 Landscaping, irrigation, and site elements
 Roofing systems and/or building form and geometry
 Other systems
– For buildings projects, perform a preliminary “simple box” energy modeling analysis before the
completion of schematic design that explores how to reduce energy loads in the building and
accomplish related S+R goals by questioning default assumptions. Assess at least two potential
strategies associated with the following:
 Site conditions: assess shading, exterior lighting, hardscape, landscaping, and adjacent site
conditions
 Massing and orientation: assess how massing and orientation affect HVAC sizing, energy
consumption, lighting, and renewable energy opportunities
 Basic envelope attributes: assess insulation values, window-to-wall ratios, glazing
characteristics, shading, and window operability
 Lighting levels: assess interior surface reflectance values and lighting levels in occupied
spaces
 Thermal comfort ranges: assess thermal comfort range options
 Plug and process load needs: assess reducing plug and process loads through programmatic
solutions (for example, equipment and purchasing policies, layout options)
 Programmatic and operational parameters: assess multifunctioning spaces, operating
schedules, space allotment per person, teleworking, reduction of building area, and
anticipated O&M
– Document how the above analysis informed design and building form decisions in the project’s
OPR and BOD and the eventual design of the project, including the following, as applicable:
 Building and site program
 Building form and geometry
 Building envelope and façade treatments on different orientations
 Elimination and/or significant downsizing of building systems (for example, HVAC, lighting,
controls, exterior materials, interior finishes, and functional program elements)
 Other systems
– Describe how all other S+R principles and performance goals will be incorporated into the design.
– Engage the client in participating in and ideally leading a design charrette process with the
assistance of the project Design Team leadership. The Design Team should embrace a systems
thinking design approach. Follow the steps of design optimization, as applicable, in
ASHRAE 189.1 Section F1.1.1 (Charrette Process). Maintain all meeting minutes as attachments
for process documentation.
• Plan for construction oversight:
– Designate a team member, other than the contractor, who will be responsible for verifying the site
is built per the construction specifications and drawings.
– Meet with the contractor prior to construction to review construction specifications, submittal
requirements, and drawings and to convey the project’s principles and performance goals.
– Describe the agreed upon method whereby changes can be made in the field during construction.
• Develop a strategy for preparing a site or project maintenance plan as appropriate:
– Include all team members in the development of the maintenance plan.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 27
– Discuss available resources (for example, budget, staff, volunteers, equipment, materials) as part
of the maintenance plan. Determine short- and long-term maintenance principles and
performance goals.
• Compile all documentation required above as project record and submit in final electronic format to
the Tyndall AFB project manager as part of the design closeout phase.
General Design Requirements
Accessible, Inclusive, Universal Design (Exceeds UFC 1-200-01)
Universal design recognizes and encourages assets inclusive for all users regardless of age, size, ability,
or disability to use an asset; it addresses multiple aspects of a built space, including infrastructure,
signage, and technologies, and together seek to enhance the opportunity for all individuals to exist
independently and comfortably in a space. Due to variations in legislation and design practices for
accessibility, usability, and inclusivity, the project criterion herein does not stipulate extensive, specific
design requirements, dimensions, or number of each type of feature within the asset. This criterion does,
however, list strategies that Design Teams must consider for integration in order to constitute a
reasonable level of provision and design of features for the type, size, and number of users of any
particular asset.
All projects must refer to the following best practice guidance as applicable to each project type:
• ISO 21542:2011, Building Construction: Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment
• BS 8300-1:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 1: External
Environment: Code of Practice
• BS 8300-2:2018, Design of an Accessible and Inclusive Built Environment, Part 2: Buildings: Code of
Practice
• Draft prEN 17210, Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment, Functional Requirements
• Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach, Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, 2012
(http://universaldesign.ie/Built-Environment/Building-for-Everyone/)
The following features must be integrated to the maximum extent possible as appropriate to each project
type after projects have met required minimum project criteria:
• Accessibility features related to access:
– Step-free external access (that is, level, gentle slope, or ramp) from the site boundary to the main
entrance(s) or alternative accessible entrance of the asset.
– Handrails to external stepped and ramped access routes to the main entrance(s) or alternative
accessible entrance of the asset.
– Where car parking is provided for the asset and asset users include parents with young children,
designated parking spaces for motorists accompanied by a child in a stroller
• Accessibility features related to horizontal and vertical circulation:
– Accessible horizontal and vertical emergency evacuation routes (such as in the event of fire) and
facilities (such as evacuation chairs) or a strategy and plan for assisted evacuation.
– Include resting areas with seating at various heights, including seating with back rests and
without arm rests
– Provide accessible routes 43 inches in width, at minimum
– Install drinking fountains, assistance animal areas, and bike racks that are easily accessed from
all sides
– Include detectable warnings (such as truncated domes) at official pedestrian crossings that
intersect with vehicular paths
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
28 04 October 2019
– Design the site with open sight lines to and from entries
• Accessibility features related to the use of a facility:
– Power-operated entrance door(s) (such as via push pad or motion sensor).
– Door and drawer hardware that requires no grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.
– Install 36-inch wide doors, at minimum, in all occupied spaces
– Provide circulation paths 20% wider than required, at minimum
– Increase clear floor space at appliances and fixtures to 30 by 52 inches, at minimum
– Increase the size of turning space to 72 inches in diameter, at minimum
• Accessibility features related to sanitary accommodation:
– Restroom(s) with an assistance alarm accessible by those who use wheelchairs, at least one of
which is a gender-neutral facility.
– Where asset users include parents with young children, baby changing facilities as well as baby
strap-in chairs accessible for all parents regardless of gender. Include family restrooms.
– Where showers, bathrooms, or changing rooms are provided for asset users, accessible versions
to accommodate persons who use wheelchairs, persons with limited mobility, and similar.
• Orientation and wayfinding:
– Well-planned layouts that clearly identify key elements such as entrances, reception areas,
sanitary facilities, and similar.
– Good lighting conditions with additional illumination at decision points such as access routes,
entrances, staircases, and elevators.
– Clear information and legible and easily understood signage, including availability in different
languages where appropriate to the asset location.
– Use of visual contrast and color to facilitate orientation and navigation, to provide warnings about
potential hazards, and to facilitate reading of information and signs.
– Provision of tactile information, for example, embossed signage, Braille signage, tactile walking
surface indicators, tactile maps, models and plans, changes in floor surface, changes in level,
tapping rails.
– Audible communication and sounds, for example, talking signs, announcement systems, audio
descriptive way-finding information, changes in walking surface.
• Assistive technologies:
– Hearing enhancement system(s) (such as induction loop) at service or reception counters and in
rooms and spaces used for meetings, lectures, classes, performances, spectator sport or films.
– Audible information systems.
– Visual alarm systems.
– Height adjustable desks, adjustable height counters (with fixtures, where applicable), and
accessible height sales and service counters.
– Voice or touch screen operated controls for devices and systems affecting occupancy of the
space and user comfort, including but not limited to, lighting, window shades, and thermostats.
Through thoughtful incorporation of accessible and universal design, projects can establish an inclusive
and enabling community where people of all abilities can effectively and easily access, use, and engage
with a space.
Adaptability and Flexible Design of Buildings
Flexible design is a priority in military facilities, as mission priorities can shift and require different
functionality needs. Having adaptable major building elements increases project space flexibility, ease of
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 29
adaptive use, and recycling of building materials while considering differential durability and premature
obsolescence over building design life and individual component service lives.
All vertical projects must produce a project-specific Functional Adaptation Study in early design phases,
prior to the completion of concept development. The study must explore design strategies that could be
used to ensure longevity of the building past initial intended use and occupancy type. Renovation projects
must incorporate strategies as applicable to the existing site or building constraints.
The functional adaptation strategy study must include exploration of the following:
• Feasibility: The likelihood to contain multiple or alternative building uses, area functions and different
tenancies over the expected life cycle, for example, related to the structural design of the building.
• Accessibility: Design aspects that facilitate the replacement of all major components within the life of
the building, for example, panels in floors and walls that can be removed without affecting the
structure, providing lifting beams and hoists. Accessibility also involves access to local services, such
as local power, data infrastructure, and similar.
• Versatility: The degree of adaptability of the internal environment to accommodate changes in
working practices.
• Adaptability: The potential of the building ventilation strategy to adapt to future building occupant
needs and climatic scenarios.
• Convertibility: The degree of adaptability of the internal physical space and external shell to
accommodate changes in use.
• Expandability: The potential for the building to be extended, horizontally, or vertically.
• Refurbishment Potential: The potential for major refurbishment, including replacing the façade.
Project design must then be informed via the study results and must implement the strategies below to
the maximum extent possible. New construction projects must include a minimum of six of the following
flexible design strategies; renovation projects must include a minimum of three:
• A flexible internal vertical loadbearing structure design with a regular column layout and few or no
loadbearing walls.
• Floor plan shapes, primary circulation routes, and floor-to-floor heights suitable for several potential
future uses.
• Use interstitial space. Design distribution zone utility systems and equipment (including HVAC,
plumbing, electrical, information technology, and life safety systems) to serve the occupied zones and
have the capacity to control multiple zones in both occupied and unoccupied spaces.
• Implement flexible power distribution (that is, plug-and-play) systems for at least 50% of the project
floor area so lighting, data, voice, and other systems can be easily reconfigured and repurposed.
• Implement a flexible lighting control system with plug-and-play components such as wall controls,
sensors, and dimming ballasts for a minimum of 50% of the lighting load. The system must allow for
reconfiguring and repurposing of luminaires and controls without rewiring (such as having the
capability to group and assign luminaires into zones and change those zones as needed). Also, the
system must be flexible so that as a space changes functions, the lighting levels can change to suit
the needs of the space without rewiring or removing or adding luminaires.
• Identify horizontal expansion capacity equal to at least 30% of existing floor area without demolition of
occupied space (other than at the connection point).
• Design for future vertical expansion on at least 75% of the roof, ensuring that existing operations and
service systems can continue at or near capacity during the expansion.
• Design at least 50% of interior nonstructural walls, ceilings, and floors to be movable or demountable.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
30 04 October 2019
• Use movable or modular casework for at least 50% of casework and custom millwork. Base the
calculation on the combined value of casework and millwork, as determined by the cost estimator or
contractor.
• Include in at least one major component or systems purchase contract a clause specifying subcontractor,
vendor, or onsite take back system. To meet the criteria for a take-back or leasing
program, the arrangement must cover a “major system or component,” defined as any product or
group of items used in the majority (more than 50%) of the project spaces where that item is relevant.
Examples of qualifying systems include ceilings, carpeting, furniture, partitions, and casework. An
example that may not qualify is built-in casework, which is typically not installed in more than half of a
project’s spaces.
• Include integral labels. Reuse and recycling extend the use of materials, but during deconstruction it
can be difficult to identify reusable and recyclable products. Specifying products with integral labels
(radio frequency identification, engraving, embossing, or other permanent marking) containing
information on material origin, properties, and date of manufacture will allow easier identification and
reuse of these materials in the future. Refer to the CSA Z782-06 Guideline for Design for
Disassembly and Adaptability in Buildings for further information on integral labeling.
• Leverage leasing arrangements. Systems such as furniture can be leased, and the vendor takes the
items back when the contract is up or the furniture is no longer needed. Leasing systems increase the
likelihood that items will be used more than once before they reach their end of life. They also remove
the burden of disposal from the project and can create an incentive to provide durable, reusable, and
recyclable products.
• Other design features deemed suitable by the Tyndall AFB project manager.
The Design Team must ensure, via coordination between their S+R Coordinator and that of the
construction team, that performance is tracked through construction to ensure that the reuse and flexibility
requirements specified in the project documents are implemented.
The following documentation must be provided to the Tyndall AFB project manager in accordance with
the above requirements:
• A copy of the study
• A narrative indicating which strategies will be implemented in the project, and justification of why
remaining strategies were not employed.
• Drawings indicating locations of interior elements
• Tracking table showing total area of all interior elements, reused interior elements, percentage of
reused elements, and cost of each element
• Tracking table for furniture and furnishings, listing all items and showing total cost, costs for reused,
salvaged, and refurbished items, and percentage of reused, salvaged, and refurbished items
• Site drawings, floor plans, and sections (as applicable) showing compliance with flexibility strategies
• Cutsheets and product information showing compliance with flexibility strategies (as applicable)
01 89 26 Site Electrical Utilities Performance Requirements
The Utilities Operations Center (UOC) and emergency generators must be designed in conformance to
UFC 3-301-01, Structural Engineering, and the program wind speed requirements (USAF, 2019a) used in
the structural design for DoD locations and implements the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
Standard 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.

01 91 00 General Commissioning Requirements
The success of Tyndall AFB is predicated on efficient facilities; reliable infrastructure; a safe work
environment for the airmen, support staff, and visitors; and relevant work environments across strategic
domains and performance dimensions.
Given the increasing complexity and interdependency of building systems, a deficiency in any one system
can have a significant impact to the overall operation and performance of other facilities. The operational
team needs to be completely trained for all building systems functionality at the component and system
levels. It is critical to the mission of the base that a process for seamlessly transitioning capital projects
from construction to full operational control is implemented.
Assurances can be provided by integrating a whole building commissioning program into each new
construction and renovation project. The program extends from planning/1391 development through
activation and occupancy. The following represent sections describe key elements of the program.
Planning and Design Phase
• Develop OPR: Includes the overall goals of the project; quality standards; operational and warranty
requirements; training expectations (BOD, equipment level, and system level); cost considerations;
and measurable performance criteria.
• Develop BOD: Describes how each element of the OPR will be implemented in the design.
• Participate in Focused Design Review: Determines if there are systematic errors and to ensure
that training and warranty requirements meet our expectations, not to fully check the design accuracy
of the Design Team.
• Develop Commissioning (Cx) Specification: Defines the administrative requirements of the
Commissioning Process and the Commissioning Authority (CxA) involvement with the contractor and
is typically included in the General Conditions.
• Develop the Cx Plan: Describes responsibilities of the Commissioning Team members, schedule,
and activities through each phase of the project delivery, documentation requirements,
communication channels, and procedures for documenting and resolving situations when verification
does not meet the Owner's Project Requirements.
• Develop the Measurement and Verification (M&V) Plan: Defines the method for evaluating and
tracking the building energy performance.

Construction Phase
• Cx Site Observation During Rough-in: During the construction phase, especially when building
systems are being installed, it is important for key members of the commissioning team to have a
regular onsite presence.
• O&M Documentation Cx Review: The coordination of O&M documentation is often left to the end of
the project and can have a negative impact on how the systems operate over the life of the building.
Early review of these documents results in improved quality and useful tools.
• Warranty Documentation Cx Review: Given the importance of proper system operation over the life
of the buildings, ensuring that equipment warranties meet the O&M team’s requirements is of critical
importance.
• Enterprise Asset Management System (EAMS)/Computerized Maintenance Management
System (CMMS) Integration: The commissioning process should verify that all assets are fully
integrated into the EAMS/CMMS. This process includes:
– Verify the asset tagging information to confirm that the EAMS/CMMS tag aligns with all other
documentation associated with a particular asset. Ideally, the naming protocol is established early
in the project so that it can be carried forward throughout the design and construction process.
– Observe actual asset tag locations and content while onsite is beneficial to confirm consistency.
– Ensue the maintenance practices incorporated in the EAMS/CMMS represent industry best
practices for that particular asset and not just boilerplate O&M data.
– Verify warranty information is properly captured in the EAMS/CMMS can prevent unintentional
repairs on equipment that is under warranty.
• Pre-Functional Testing: Pre-functional checklists (PFCs) are used to ensure the equipment and
systems are installed and operational in accordance with the contract documents and that Functional
Performance Testing (FPT) may proceed without unnecessary delays. The Cx team prepares the
PFCs that address asset labeling, equipment delivery, installation, start-up, and building automation
system configuration for all systems and equipment being commissioned.
• Equipment Start-up: Is the first chance to observe the equipment in its operating condition and is an
essential part of the Cx process.
• Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing (TAB) Review: TAB is a critical element of the project delivery
process. The CxA should work with construction team to coordinate their activities of the TAB
contractor for each project.
• Training Planning: As part of the training planning process, the training requirements should be
reviewed against the expectations and requirements of the O&M team.
Testing and Training
• Attend Planning Meetings: The Cx team schedules, organizes, leads, and supervises the functional
performance testing, with the involvement of the installing contractors to operate systems.
• Functional Performance Testing: This is the dynamic testing of systems under full operation.
– An FPT only commences when the pre-functional testing and checklists are complete and
approved by the CxA and O&M team.
– Systems are tested under various modes (such as during low loads, high loads, component
failures, unoccupied, varying outdoor conditions, alarm conditions, and utility failures). The
systems are run through all the Energy Management Control System (EMCS)sequences of
operation and components are verified to be responding as intended. When systems do not pass
a test, issues are clearly documented in an issues log. Items in the log are reviewed and closed
through the issue resolution process. Systems are then re-tested.
– The results of this phase establish the operational baseline for the systems and their
components. The O&M team time commitment can be significant, particularly for a large project.
DIVISION 01 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 33
O&M team participation during FPT is possibly the best method of introducing building systems to
those responsible for operating them. Systems to be commissioned include:
 Mechanical
 Electrical
 Plumbing
 Life safety (Fire Protection and Fire Alarm System)
 Energy Management and Control Systems
 Building Envelope
 Low voltage
o Security
o Mass notification
o Distributed Antennae
o Synchronized Clock System
 Conveyance/vertical transportation
• Integrated Systems Testing (IST): The building systems’ interoperability is verified under a number
of failure scenarios. In critical facilities, this is an industry standard best Cx practice. The primary test
is when the normal power supply to the building is “turned off” and the team observes how the
building systems respond. During this test, not only are generators, fuel systems, and transfer
switching tested, but many other integrated systems are verified for performance under these
conditions. While on normal power and emergency power, the team needs to verify that the EMCS,
fire alarm, security, and other systems continue to operate as designed regardless of power source or
power switching. It is common to find some systems do not perform correctly when switching to
emergency power or back to normal power. The IST process is the first time the O&M team will be
exposed to emergency management procedures related to the new facility and the lessons learned
are extremely valuable. The results of this testing often drives institutional standard operating
procedures (SOPs) and utility management plans.
• Corrective Action: Corrective Issue Reports (CIRs) are generated by the CxA when issues or
problems arise during the Cx process. The report will describe the problem condition along with any
related reference information and issued to the construction team for corrective action. When the
necessary corrections have been completed, the actions taken are documented and the item is
closed in the issues log. Depending on the nature of the issue or problem, the CxA, along with the
project stakeholders, will determine if re-testing of the equipment or system is necessary. It is
important to have the O&M team engaged during the corrective issues process so the issue is clearly
understood by all parties and everyone understands the resolution.
• Owner Training: Training is one of the most important aspects of turning the project over to the O&M
team. As-built documents, O&M manuals, and all approved submittals should be turned over to the
O&M staff prior to any training. The delivery of close-out materials should be verified by the CxA. The
training must include both component/equipment level and integrated system level sessions. All
training sessions should follow the pre-approved agendas and plans, all attendees should sign the
attendance sheet during the sessions, and a follow-up evaluation is performed to verify the trainees
were provided with the pertinent information to properly operate and maintain the facility. All training
materials should be captured and translated into a format, such as PowerPoint, that allows for new
hire training as well as continuous training of current staff. Training sessions are only effective if
attended by the appropriate personnel. At this point in the transition to operational control, there
should be representation from each responsible shift attending the training sessions for each building
system. This is another critical step in the delivery process.
Post Construction
• Finalize SOPs: One of the keys to achieving operational excellence is having clear, concise
documentation on how the integrated building systems function as a whole. As part of the systems
manual, SOPs for all potential conditions should be provided. These should be developed to allow for
the documents to be laminated and placed on or near the primary system components and control
points. In a “critical to mission” environment, being able to respond to an unplanned incident quickly
and effectively can have a direct impact on mission readiness and being prepared for such an event
is the best way to mitigate that risk. During the development of the standard operating procedures,
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 01
34 04 October 2019
the Cx/O&M team plays a vital role where they need to define their team composition and provide
input to the level of detail desired for each system.
• Seasonal/Deferred Testing: Despite all the efforts of the Cx team members to complete all
verification testing prior to project close-out and occupancy, identify any systems that cannot be
tested at this juncture because of project phasing and/or weather conditions. Any seasonal
verification issues will be well documented and the appropriate Cx team members will need to be
convened to carry out these tests. The need for O&M team involvement is crucial because the facility
is now occupied and under their control. These tests will need to be closely coordinated to ensure
occupant comfort and overall life safety is not impacted.
• Warranty Item Review and Verification: Ideally, 10 months into the 12-month warranty period the
team returns to meet with the specific O&M personnel. This process should include and be recorded
in the Final Cx Report:
– Review of O&M experience in operating various systems
– Recommendations for improvement
– Warranty claims registered during the first months of operation
– Record documentation of any warranty items that require follow-up
– Summary of O&M personnel recommendations for system performance enhancements
– O&M staff requests for additional and/or supplementary training sessions
– Suggestions for improvements in the Cx process to be implemented on future projects
• M&V Implementation: To ensure that energy performance goals are achieved, incorporating
measurement and verification elements into the project delivery process is essential. Even though the
facilities will be brand new, the design phase began several years ago and there may be
opportunities for further energy consumption savings. Throughout construction, the team may identify
additional measures that should be considered for future savings.
– M&V should be implemented during the warranty phase and after a full year of occupancy.
– The energy performance of the facilities should be observed and the performance documented.
Since full occupancy may be well beyond the initial warranty period, the operational team should
review the performance after a full year of occupancy to verify that the true targeted goals are
being achieved and to identify any additional measures that may be implemented.
• Final EMCS Training: Final training on EMCS needs to occur within the first month of occupancy.
Several training sessions prior to occupancy will help the O&M staff establish baseline knowledge.
The final training will focus on system level operations within the occupied facility.
• Long-term Training: A long-term training planning should address core competency requirements
that align with the building systems in place. With an ongoing training plan in place, the O&M team
will be able to operate the facilities safely, efficiently, and effectively under all operating conditions.
• Develop Monitoring Based Cx Program: A continuous process to resolve operating issues,
improve comfort, and optimize energy use. Using the successfully commissioned systems as the
baseline, all the operating parameters and sequences of operation are recorded. Through the EMCS,
“trigger” points are identified, and alarms are initiated when a system is performing out of its
optimized range. These points can include efficiency rating (kilowatts per ton [kW/ton]), a setpoint
(static pressure), or total runtime (hours) – individually or in a combination. Monthly reports should be
generated that allow the O&M team to search for anomalies. This process verifies that the building
and systems performance are optimized to meet the current operating requirements, which ultimately
extends the useful life of an asset and reduces the operating costs.

1.2. SUMMARY
A. The purpose of the Cx Process is to provide the Owner with independent verification that the
systems to be commissioned have been constructed according to the contract documents and
operate within the performance guidelines set forth in the OPR, the BOD, the project construction
drawings, and specifications. Commissioning consists of systematically documenting that
specified components and systems have been installed and activated properly and then
functionally tested to verify and document proper operation through all sequences of operation
and conditions. In addition, training of the Owner’s O&M personnel will be verified, and final
project O&M documents will be reviewed for completeness and to support the successful
transition from construction phase to the occupancy and use phase.
B. The commissioning process does not alleviate or reduce the responsibility of the design
professionals, construction managers, or installing contractors to provide a complete and finished
product, installed and fully functional in accordance with the contract documents.
C. Commissioning is intended to enhance the quality of system start-up and aid in the orderly
transfer of systems for use and maintenance by the Owner. Quality Cx requires participation by
all parties involved with the project design and construction process, including the Owner, Design
Team, construction managers and contractors, and the Owner’s Facilities Management.
D. The Commissioning Authority will lead the Cx team, planning and coordinating all commissioning
activities in conjunction with Cx team members.

DIVISION 07 THERMAL AND MOISTURE
PROTECTION
All manufactured products falling under this category must have a current Miami-Dade NOA that
demonstrates compliance with the wind pressures determined from the wind speed (USAF, 2019a)
above.
This section describes materials required to be used as vapor barriers, exterior finishes, weather barriers,
roof covers, air barriers, and thermal insulation (building insulation) to prevent unwanted exterior weatherrelated
elements from entering the building.
A building’s exterior thermal and moisture barrier envelope must have an insulation system with an
R-value to meet the appropriate code-required criteria and meet the designed energy use goals of
the facility.
Avoid use of insulation that, if exposed to water infiltration, can retain water. All metal to be used on the
exterior facade must meet the manufacturers finish requirements for coastal environment for warranties.
07 20 00 THERMAL PROTECTION
07 21 00 Thermal Insulation
Exterior wall systems must only use polyiso or high density closed cell foam.
Outboard insulation (the “perfect” wall) must have vapor retarders.
Air and water infiltration standards must be met for all envelope barrier assemblies.
Consider installing radiant barriers with manufacturer’s perforated option directly at the inside face of the
roof deck to reduce cooling loads and to ensure proper passage of moisture through the radiant barrier.
Do not install radiant barriers in such a way that they create a secondary vapor barrier.
07 22 00 Roof and Deck Insulation
Insulate concrete roof slabs and ceilings or attics to improve thermal performance and occupant comfort.
Consider low-emission (formaldehydes), high recycled content, non-ozone-depleting insulation materials.
For roof insulation, provide polyisocyanurate board that is in accordance with ASTM C1289 REV A,
except that the minimum compressive strength must be 20 pounds per square inch (psi) (140 kilopascals)
(Type I, foil faced on both sides).
Use closed-cell rigid polyisocyanurate board insulation for the roof and deck insulation and create
outboard insulation systems that provide the “perfect” thermal and moisture barrier condition with the use
of vapor retarders.
Use glass mat gypsum roof board for the underlayment and cover board that adheres to ASTM
C1177/C1177M, 0 Flame Spread and 0 Smoke Developed when tested in accordance with ASTM E84,
500 psi, Class A, non-combustible, 5/8 inch thick, 4 by 8 feet .
Fasten insulation to resist uplift pressure at the corners, perimeter, and field of the roof to meet the wind
requirements stated herein..
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 07
62 04 October 2019
Install cover boards over insulation so the long joints are in continuous straight lines with end joints
staggered between the rows. Loosely butt the cover boards together and fasten to roof deck to resist the
wind load requirements.
07 26 00 Vapor Retarders
Incorporate vapor retarders at exterior wall and roofing assemblies on the humid moisture-laden warm
side of the wall or roof to restrict moisture from entering the facility envelope.
• Polyethylene sheeting, Class 1 with a permeance of less than 0.1 perms, ASTM E 1745, joints taped
• A below-slab vapor barrier having a permeance rating below 0.01 perms
Provide vapor barriers under and around slab-on-grade foundations and footings to prevent moisture
vapor from rising up from the subgrade through the concrete and entering into interior spaces.
Moisture entering the building as well as wall and roof construction cavities can lead to moisture problems
when trapped moisture cannot escape, mold forms, and building materials become damaged.
07 27 00 Air Barriers
Air barrier performance is critical to energy performance and building durability because leaking
assemblies allow moist air to penetrate the building, which wastes energy, causes mold, damages
building components, and causes discomfort to those inside.
Air barriers must be continuous across the entire building envelope, including continuity among floors,
walls, and roof assemblies.
Air barrier performance must be tested in accordance with ASTM E779, and the infiltration must not
exceed 0.15 cfm/ft2 of envelope at 75 Pa.
Provide materials in the following categories as used in the air barrier system or assembly of the exterior
wall system are tested and are required to conform to ASTM E2178:
• Self-adhered sheet membranes
• Fluid applied membranes
• Spray polyurethane foam
• Accessory products
A construction mock-up must be provided.
Fasten the thermal barrier to the roof deck as required to resist the wind design standard uplift forces with
corrosion-resistant fasteners.
07 30 00 STEEP SLOPE ROOFING
Roofs must be designed to be waterproof, drain quickly, be long-lasting, resilient to the Florida sun, easy
to flash penetrations through, and easy to maintain. Roofs designed to drain with excessive penetrations
and complex configurations are known in the industry as being difficult to flash and waterproof.
Overhangs extensions are acceptable but must provide protection of walls and fenestration below, but not
so wide they will be affected and damaged by high hurricane winds.
DIVISION 07 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 63
Steep-sloped roof designs are preferred to low-slope roofs wherever possible because of the area’s high
rainfall. Steep-sloped roofing systems must be constructed with a minimum slope of 4:12 unless
otherwise required by functional criteria. Sloped roofs may have various geometries. Gable or hip-style
roofs best. A hip-style roof design is preferred because it has proven resistance to wind uplift forces.
Severely steep sloped roofs of greater than 5:12 pitch should be avoided because they can become
“sails” that catch more wind and are subject to both higher uplift and overturning forces.
07 40 00 ROOFING AND SIDING PANELS
Both the fascia and soffit must be of the same material as the roofing. Vents and piping that must
penetrate a roof must be treated as trim material and painted to match the roof. If possible, such elements
should be located on areas out of view.

at time of Government’s acceptance of the roof work.
Do not use less than 18-gauge (1.27 millimeter [mm]). Use roll-form aluminum roof panels. The profile
must be a 2-1/2-inch-high standing seam that includes mechanical crimping with concealed clips and
fasteners.
07 41 10 Attachment Clips
Provide or fabricate stainless-steel clips. Size, shape, thickness, and capacity must meet the specified
insulation thickness and design load criteria.
07 42 00 Wall Panels
Insulated metal wall panels must be of a thickness to satisfy energy codes and energy conservation
goals. Use 24-gauge aluminum metal skins with rigid insulation cores, lap seams, flat, and embossed with
light texture.
Insulated metal wall panels may be used if they are watertight, installed watertight, and are of the
interlocking type to provide a continuous weather tight building envelope.
All breakaway walls in all flood hazard areas must have flood openings.
Uninsulated wall panels must be 18 gauge and similar to the roof panels.
07 42 60 Foam-Insulation Core Wall Panel
Provide factory-formed aluminum wall panel assembly fabricated from two sheets of metal with modified
polyisocyanurate or polyurethane foam insulation core (foamed-in-place) during fabrication with joints
between panels designed to form weather-tight seals. Include accessories required for weather-tight
installation.

64 04 October 2019
07 50 00 MEMBRANE ROOFING
• Membrane roofing must be capable of at least 150% elongation, and recovery and must be adhered
to the substrate.
• The material selected must withstand ponding water, especially if the roof slope is less than 1/2 inch
in 12 inches and if the coating is protecting topside insulation.
• Heavy self-adhering or liquid applied self-sealing air or vapor barriers should be used.
Due to concerns with heavy rains, heat, mold, and humidity requirements, fluid-applied silicone materials
with non-woven polyester full fabric reinforcement and integrated mildewcide/anti-staining agents are the
preferred fluid-applied roofing system, as it is durable, self-cleaning, and has multiple color selections.
Other fluid-applied roofing systems, such as urethane or silicone-based coatings, can be considered if
these systems include continuous full fabric non-woven polyester reinforcement. Elastomeric roof coating
system with color other than white must be warrantied against excessive fading for 10 years.
Roof-coating systems must provide a minimum 20-year warranty.
To reduce heat island effect, use light-colored roofing materials that have a high solar reflectance, highinfrared
emittance, and good connective heat transfer.
Provide roof coatings with low-VOC, recycled content, and bio-based content coatings, if appropriate, and
in compliance with the criteria set forth in Division 01.
For flat roofs, provide an 80-mil thermoplastic polyolefin roofing membrane that is fully adhered .is
preferred
Flexible walkways must have factory-formed, nonporous, heavy-duty, solid-rubber, slip-resisting, surfacetextured
walkway pads, approximately 3/16-inch (5-mm) thick, and acceptable to the membrane roofing
system manufacturer.
07 60 00 FLASHING AND SHEET METAL
Flashing and sheet metal are necessary materials to provide building envelope closure and resilience to
weather (close gaps and prevent the weather from penetrating the building envelope).
07 62 00 Sheet Metal Flashing and Trim
Long-lasting flashings, to include copper and stainless steel, should be specified. Flashings must be
resistant to decay from salts. If using anodized, provide an additional coating for coastal environments as

07 70 00 ROOF AND WALL SPECIALTIES AND ACCESSORIES
07 71 00 Roof Specialties
Roof specialties such as soffit vents, eave vents, membrane vents, premanufactured roof penetrations
are required to facilitate that all roof cover penetrations are made watertight, resilient to the weather and
seal out water infiltration.
Penetrations such as vents, roof hatches, skylights, and similar must not be installed in roofs of new
facilities due to previous historical damage from hurricanes which incurred costly water damage.
Eliminate these and similar items unless required by other criteria.
Roof parapets are not to be used to the maximum extent possible because heavy rainfall and hurricanegenerated
windborne flying debris may collect behind these walls and restrict runoff, which could lead to
structural failure. Where facility design warrants roof parapets, the Designer of Record (DOR) must
provide an appropriately designed roof drainage system that will include drain overflows. Roof drain
overflows must be located at all roof drain locations and must be minimum of 4 inches high by
12 inches wide.
07 72 00 Roof Accessories
Roof-mounted equipment and roof penetrations have historically caused or contributed to costly hurricane
damage. Eliminate these and similar items unless required by other criteria.
Design the facility to eliminate roof openings:
• Incorporate wall fenestrations (windows, light shelves, clerestories with hurricane-rated glazing
blocks). Do not use skylights. Skylight applications are not desirable and must require a waiver from
the base Architect.
• When practical, locate solar water panels, photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines other electrical
equipment, and mechanical equipment at ground level. Fully adhered building-integrated PV systems
must be considered.
• Do not use interior ladders to access roof hatches. Incorporate wall-mounted exterior ladders
complying with antiterrorism/force protection (ATFP) requirements (lockable access, located within a
controlled area).
Downspouts are to be prefinished to match the background color against which they are viewed. This
often results in the downspout being painted more than a single color.
All rooftop elements on sloped standing-seam metal roofs that can be viewed must be prefinished to
match the roof color.
Internal roof drains are discouraged.
07 77 00 Wall Specialties
Textured Acrylic Finish System is acceptable for high-impact environments.
Use of glass fiber reinforcing mesh in the base coats is recommended:
• Back wrap the entire perimeter.

07 90 00 JOINT PROTECTION
Preconstruction Compatibility and Adhesion Testing
Submit to the joint-sealant manufacturers eight samples of materials that will contact or affect joint
sealants. Use the manufacturer's standard test method to determine whether priming and other specific
joint preparation techniques are required to obtain rapid, optimum adhesion of joint sealants to joint
substrates.
Preconstruction Field-Adhesion Testing
Before installing sealants, field test their adhesion to the project’s joint substrates. Test the joint sealants
according to Method A, Field-Applied Sealant Joint Hand Pull Tab, in Appendix X1 in ASTM C 1193 or
Method A, Tail Procedure, in ASTM C 1521.
07 92 00 Joint Sealants
Joint sealants are used to prevent water from penetrating into the building through the building joints. All
penetrations and building envelope penetrations where two or more materials are located next to one
another have a space between them. Installing sealant in the joint will stop blowing water from
penetrating into the building envelope, thus adding another layer of resiliency to the building
envelope design.
• Provide sealant materials selected for compatibility with each other and with substrates in each joint
system. Confirm compatibility and application with the sealant material manufacturer to confirm the
proper type of sealant and installation.
• Provide elastomeric sealants that comply with ASTM C 920 for joints between aluminum storefront

ceramic coated wall board screws, galvanized G90 light-gauge framing, and non-cellulose spray on foam
insulation where needed.
Durability, maintenance, and cost-efficiency are primary considerations in choosing interior finishes.
Neutral base colors with contrasting accented accessories should be applied when appropriate. Specialty
areas may have specific requirements that need to be determined on an individual basis. The designer
must consider the applicable UFC, building codes, fire ratings, acoustical performance, structural needs,
and thermal and moisture transmission characteristics when designing project-specific interior
assemblies. Where a conflict exists within this standard and other applicable codes or standards, the
more stringent must apply. If a selected material subsequently proves to be unavailable during design or
construction, samples of alternative materials must be submitted for approval, prior to placing orders.
Permanent finishes are generally the hard surface structural interior design finishes that will last 15 to
20 years and whose removal and re-installation is a major disruption to the facility. Such items as vinyl
composition tile (VCT), ceramic and other surface tile, plastic laminates, toilet partitions, lockers, window
blinds, all modular or systems furniture panels, work surfaces, flipper doors, and similar are considered
permanent finishes. Generally permanent finishes need to be a color that will not become dated in a

09 30 00 TILING
All tile work must be performed only by companies that are members of the Tile Council of North America
(TCNA) and must comply with the latest TCNA installation handbook.
• Do not install porous surfaces in high-traffic areas.
• Use lower absorption-level tiles to have a greater resistance against stains.
• Install larger tiles, 12 inches by 12 inches, in high-traffic areas to minimize grout lines.
Breaking Strength: In order to determine the strength and durability of ceramic tile, a standard test
method (ASTM C648) is used to evaluate the tile. A force is applied to an unsupported portion of the tile
specimen until breakage occurs. The ultimate breaking strength is then recorded in pounds. The ANSI
standard requires an average breaking strength of 250 pounds for floor tile.
Coefficient of Friction: This is a term used in physics to describe the amount of force required to cause
an object to start moving across a surface. Tiles are tested for coefficient of friction in accordance with
ASTM C-1028. A quantitative value can be determined to generally express the relative degree of slip
resistance. A higher coefficient indicates increased resistance. Although there is no current ANSI
requirement, a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.50 (wet and dry) is the recognized industry standard for
a slip-resistant flooring surface. The OSHA also recommends this same standard for walking surfaces.
The ADA recommends a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) for accessible routes and
0.80 for ramps.
Scratch Hardness (Mohs Hardness): The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that
should be addressed when selecting tile. Scratch resistance of glazes is measured by scratching the
surface of the tile with different minerals and assigning a “Mohs Scale Hardness” number to the glaze, the
softest mineral used is talc (a rating of 1) and the hardest is a diamond (a rating of 10 if no scratch). Most
glazes used on ceramic tile fall in the five to six range, which is also slightly harder than most steels.
Case-hardened steel, such as what is used in drill bits, is approximately six and will scratch most glazes.
Quartz, No. 7 on the Mohs scale, will scratch most glazes (sand is a common example of natural quartz).
Tile is appropriate for all areas that may be subject to high foot traffic, wetness, and require the need for
increased durability, for example, dining facilities, kitchens, break rooms, restrooms, entry lobbies, floors,
walls, and similar.
Technical Criteria: Select tile based on the performance criteria appropriate for the functional use of the
space. There are five properties of ceramic tile to consider: coefficient of friction, durability classification or
Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI), scratch hardness, breaking strength, and water absorption.
Select tiles with the following properties:
• Coefficient of Friction: Floor tile must have a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) or
higher in accordance with ASTM C-1028. Standing water and other contaminants create slippery
conditions for any hard surface floor material. Floor applications with exposure to these conditions
require extra caution in the tile selection. Use abrasive grains or raised textured tile for greater
traction in areas with the possibility of standing water or grease build up.
• Durability Classification: Floor tile must be Class IV—Heavy Traffic, durability classification as rated
by the manufacturer when tested in accordance with ASTM C-1027 for abrasion resistance as related
to foot traffic. Class III can be considered for residential installations.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 09
80 04 October 2019
• Scratch Hardness: Glazed floor tile must have a scratch hardness of 6.0 or higher. Do not use
glazed tile in areas of high abuse where possible tile breakage may occur. Avoid high gloss or
polished tiles for areas with high traffic; use only as accents in floor patterns.
• Breaking Strength: Tile must be impact-resistant with a minimum breaking strength of 250 pounds in
accordance with ASTM C-648.
• Water Absorption: Use only vitreous or impervious tile for most applications in accordance with
ASTM C-373.
Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The
pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile.
Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts.
• Slip Resistance: This is a major factor in the selection of tiles for kitchens and entrance lobbies.
There are numerous products that have slip-resisting features for lobbies. Unglazed quarry tile works
best for commercial kitchen floor installations. Because of the possibility of water and grease spillage,
unglazed tile must be sealed in kitchens.
• Color: Recommend tile with through-color, that is, color the entire thickness of the tile body. Avoid
solid color tiles unless designed into a pattern. Avoid light-colored quarry tile in commercial kitchens.
Colors and patterns must be approved by the Government.
• Texture: Tiles with a textured surface and an interesting variation of colors will tend to show less
surface soiling.
• Grout: Select medium to dark pigmented grouts. Light grouts tend to change color and trap soil over
time. Minimize the visibility of grout by using larger-sized tile.
• Base: Use a matching tile base in commercial kitchens and other areas subject to excessive water. In
other locations, wood or vinyl base may be appropriate. Ensure that there is an aesthetical transition
If possible, use a dark tone grout, which coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled
appearance.
09 50 00 CEILINGS
09 53 00 Acoustical Ceiling Suspension Assemblies
• Provide ceiling suspension that meets seismic requirements under the International Building Code.
• Wire hangers, braces, and ties: Use zinc-coated carbon-steel; ASTM A 641, Class 1 zinc coating, soft
temper.
• Tiles must be snug to grid, and the grid must be square and level. Penetrations must be centered in
tiles and the system must be centered within room.
• Install hold-down clips were required.
09 60 00 FLOORING
Use products that are moisture and mold/mildew-resistant, such as hard tiles with breathable grout joints
and breathable sealed concrete. Use only ceramic tile floor tiles, terrazzo, or other nonabsorbent floor
finishes on first floors and slabs on grade especially at entrance areas where hurricane flooding
can occur.
Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The
pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile.
Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts.
DIVISION 09 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 81
• Slip Resistance: This is a major factor in the selection of tiles for kitchens and entrance lobbies.
There are numerous products that have slip-resisting features for lobbies. Unglazed quarry tile works
best for commercial kitchen floor installations. Because of the possibility of water and grease spillage,
unglazed tile must be sealed in kitchens.
• Color: Recommend tile with through-color, that is, color through the entire thickness of the tile body.
Avoid solid color tiles unless designed into a pattern. Avoid light-colored quarry tile in commercial
kitchens. Colors and patterns must be approved by the Government.
• Texture: Tiles with a textured surface and an interesting variation of colors will tend to show less
surface soiling.
• Grout: Select medium to dark pigmented grouts. Light grouts tend to change color and trap soil over
a period of time. Minimize the visibility of grout by using larger-sized tile.
• Base: Use a matching tile base in commercial kitchens and other areas subject to excessive water. In
other locations, wood or vinyl base may be appropriate. Ensure there is a visually pleasing transition
between different materials.
09 61 36 Static-Resistant Flooring Treatment
Static-dissipative VCT (non-asbestos formulated) must be used in server rooms and other areas.
09 64 00 Wood Flooring

Except where noted, all corridors, labs, and support areas must receive VCT.
Welded seam rubber sheet flooring is an alternative to resilient flooring. Depending on chemical usage
and traffic, welded seam rubber flooring with a minimum thickness of 3.0 mm, may be an acceptable
alternative to VCT some laboratories, lab support areas, and equipment areas.
Resilient Base and Accessories
All VCT floors must have a 4- or 6-inch rubber base in color to match existing new base, be a minimum of
1/8-inch thick, and in a color selected by the architect. All fixed casework must have a 4-inch rubber base.
Prefabricated or formed corners should not be used.
Performance Characteristics and Other Criteria
• Provide resistant tile flooring per ASTM F 1066, Class 2 (through-pattern tile).
• Provide vinyl strip that produces a smooth transition and protects exposed edges of tile and carpet.
• Provide vinyl, FS SS-W-40, Type II cove top toe 4-inch base with a minimum thickness of 0.80.
Avoid using sheet vinyl flooring on concrete floor slabs as this flooring traps moisture. VCT are extremely
difficult to install in hot, humid climates and require rigorous installation procedures to eliminate moisturecaused
adhesion failure of the VCT floor to concrete slab-on-grade substrates.
Resilient flooring tiles must comply with the requirements of 09 30 00 Tiling.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 09

Concrete Subfloors
Verify that concrete slabs comply with ASTM F 710 and the following:
• Slab substrates are dry and free of curing compounds, sealers, hardeners, and other materials that
may interfere with adhesive bond.
• Determine adhesion and dryness characteristics by performing bond and moisture tests
recommended by the following:
– Carpet manufacturer.
– Carpet cushion manufacturer. Subfloors are free of cracks, ridges, depressions, scale, and
foreign deposits.
Be careful not to overdo borders. In corridors, a border of approximately 9 inches wide is appropriate.
09 70 00 WALL FINISHES
Wall materials must be chosen based on the function of the facility and the materials of the adjacent
structures. The goal is to limit the pallet of materials used on base and ease the transition between the
wide variety of existing materials by adjusting the proportions and details of the approved materials.
Consistent application of colors and materials will bind the base together and reduce visual clutter caused
by too much diversity.
Use only base standard materials and colors. Minimize surfaces requiring painting and cleaning.
Use integral colored materials and factory finished building products to reduce maintenance.
Use sealant to match or blend with surface materials and color.
09 72 00 Wall Coverings
Do not use vinyl wall coverings and other wall coverings, paneling, paints, solid back splashes, and other
materials that do not breathe because it can create a second vapor barrier trapping moisture within
construction and cause mold growth.
09 90 00 PAINTING AND COATING
09 91 00 Painting
Partial or spot painting is not acceptable. If part of a surface requires painting, then the entire surface will
have to be painted or repainted in order to reach a corner or a different material.

04 October 2019 153
DIVISION 23 HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIRCONDITIONING
(HVAC)
The HVAC systems must support Tyndall AFB as an Installation of the Future. Designs must incorporate
resilience, sustainability, and SMART technologies focusing on areas of energy efficiency, appropriate
life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), flood and environmental protection for equipment, metering, and
monitoring and commissioning.
Building function, climate, and location must be included in the analysis when selecting a mechanical
system. Passive design aspects must be included in the mechanical system designs. For example, actual
building envelope materials, shading, and air barriers must be included in equipment sizing.
The primary method of space conditioning will be ducted HVAC systems that use a building-wide chilled
water loop for cooling and a building-wide hot water loop for heating. Individual split systems, window
units, and fan coil units are not preferred.
Durability, availability of replacement parts in the local area (near Tyndall AFB), maintainability, type of
warranty, and service from local manufacturing representatives must be taken into consideration during
design and procurement.
All other HVAC equipment not explicitly defined must be designed for the program wind speed
requirements (USAF, 2019a). Such HVAC equipment must be designed and detailed to meet all
requirements of the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone provisions of the latest edition of the FBC for the
applicable sections related to their material types.
23 00 00 HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR-CONDITIONING (HVAC)
• When possible, the use of central cooling plants for adjacent buildings are highly encouraged.
Cooling plants must be designed for energy efficiency, flexibility, and resiliency.
• Use values from the latest version of UFC 3-400-02, Engineering Weather Data. Do not use ASHRAE
design temperatures.
• Tyndall AFB has corrosive, salt-laden air that accelerates degradation of materials. Infrastructure
must be designed and installed to accomplish design performance and life spans in an aggressively
corrosive marine environment. Designs must address measures taken to resist the effects of
corrosion.
• Sand entrained in the wind has a sand blasting effect on infrastructure at Tyndall AFB. Corrosionresistant
coatings that have been subjected to scratches or nicks do not prevent the establishment of
corrosion cells that degrade materials. It is, therefore, important that intrinsically corrosion-resistant
materials, such as Type 316 stainless steel, for example, be used for outdoor enclosures and for
structural support.
• Provide positive ventilation in attics and crawl spaces.
• Positive pressurization of buildings to offset infiltration is recommended at approximately 0.05-inch
water gauge (WG) or 8% greater than exhaust air.
• Pre-treat ventilation air when feasible and perform a National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) building life cycle cost (BLLC) analysis, latest version, as documentation.
• When evaluating systems at Tyndall AFB, use the NIST BLCC program to develop the LCCA, the
LCCA must include the following:
– All associated system equipment (for example, the chiller LCCA must include pumps, motors,
fans, chillers, cooling towers, and piping)
– Factors for Tyndall AFB's environment (including salt corrosion, sand blasting, and degradation)
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 23
154 04 October 2019
– Inflation, first costs, replacement costs, O&M costs, and similar
– A replacement life span specific to the Tyndall AFB area
– Rental equipment to support missions while equipment is being replaced
– Equipment efficiencies at full load, part load, peak, and off-peak seasons
– Tyndall AFB-specific utility rates
• Dedicated outdoor air systems are preferred and must be used on systems with an outdoor air flow
rate above 750 cfm to pre-condition outdoor air before serving distribution AHUs or conditioned
space. A dedicated outdoor air handler must be equipped with an energy-recovery ventilator that
uses a desiccant heat wheel or flat plate heat exchanger to transfer load between exhaust air and
non-hazardous outdoor air. Outdoor air systems are to be screened by CMU walls.
• Natural ventilation should be avoided at Tyndall AFB because of moisture and mold issues. When
natural ventilation is used, controls must be included to automatically open and close windows/vents
to optimize system performance. The design analysis must also clearly define how undesired
moisture problems will be mitigated and eliminated.
• Systems must be designed to incorporate indoor air quality best practices:
– Locate outdoor air intakes away from nearby sources of pollutants and water sources that may
introduce legionella.
– Incorporate airflow monitoring equipment into the HVAC system design. The technique for
monitoring outdoor air depends on the HVAC system.
– For residential units, each dwelling unit must be provided with carbon monoxide monitors for
each floor.
– Sufficiently exhaust each space where hazardous gases or chemicals may be present or used
(for example, garages, housekeeping and laundry areas, and copying and printing rooms), using
a minimum of 0.50 cfm per square foot (2.54 liters per second per square meter), to create
negative pressure with respect to adjacent spaces when the doors to the room are closed. Install
monitoring systems with sensors designed to detect the specific contaminants. An alarm must
indicate any unusual or unsafe conditions. Consider typical substances found in the particular
building type, and review activities and processes that will occur. Substances might include
cleaning supplies, laboratory chemicals, or materials required for vehicular maintenance.
 Monitors must measure the following within a regularly occupied or common space in the
building, as appropriate by building and activity type:
o Particulate matter (accuracy 2 micrograms per cubic meter [μg/m³] + 15% of reading at
values between 0 and 150 μg/m³)
o CO2 (accuracy 50 ppm + 3% of reading at values between 400 and 2,000 ppm)
o Carbon monoxide (accuracy 1 ppm at values between 0 and 10 ppm)
o Ozone (accuracy 10 parts per billion [ppb] at values between 0 and 100 ppb)
o Nitrogen dioxide (accuracy 20 ppb at values between 0 and 100 ppb)
o Total VOCs (accuracy 20 μg/m³ + 20% of reading at values between 150 and 2,000 ppm)
o Formaldehyde (accuracy 20 ppb at values between 0 and 100 ppb)
 Monitor density is minimum one per floor or one every 3,500 feet, whichever is more
stringent. Monitors are sited at locations compliant with the following requirements:
o 3 to 6 feet above the finished floor at locations where occupants would typically be
seated or standing.
o Sampling points must be at least 3.3 feet away from doors, windows, and air supply or
exhaust outlets.
DIVISION 23 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 155
o Measurements are taken at intervals of no longer than 10 minutes for particulate matter
and CO2 and no longer than 1 hour for other pollutants.
– Typically, apparatus bays in fire stations or similar facilities are not designed for human
occupancy and would not be required to meet the above requirements. If these spaces will
be occupied, however, they must be ventilated according to the applicable reference
standard above.
– Vehicle repair facilities and maintenance bay-space types include military buildings where trucks,
tanks, aircraft, and other vehicles are being serviced. Because these are occupied spaces, they
must meet the above requirements.
– For healthcare facilities, determine the minimum outdoor air intake flow for mechanical ventilation
systems using the ventilation rates in ASHRAE 170, Ventilation of Health Care Facilities (with
errata), or the requirements of the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) Guidelines for Design and
Construction of Health Care Facilities. For any area not covered in ASHRAE 170 or the FGI
guidelines, follow ASHRAE 62.1 or a local equivalent, whichever is more stringent and meets the
minimum requirements of ASHRAE 170.
– For commercial kitchen spaces, makeup air velocity near (or directed at) the hood is less than
75 fpm, replacement air introduced directly into the exhaust hood cavity does not exceed 10% of
the hood exhaust airflow rate, and at least 50% of the air that replaces the exhaust air is
conditioned transfer air rather than makeup air.
• Systems must be designed to incorporate thermal comfort:
– Spaces must be designed to accommodate 98% of the standard occupied hours of the year, 95%
of regularly occupied spaces achieve thermal conditions representing Predicted Mean Vote levels
within ±0.5; Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied ≤10% (per ASHRAE 55).
– For commercial kitchen spaces, the operative temperature in the kitchen does not exceed 80°F at
any time.

installation of cooling device(s) that allow tenants to maintain desirable comfort conditions in
bedrooms and living spaces.
• Provide separate mechanical, electrical, and communications rooms.
• Avoid placing HVAC units and any other mechanical equipment on top of roofs (that is, no
penetrations through roofs) due to problems with roof leaks, accessibility, and maintainability
requirements. If rooftop equipment is necessary, use existing roof warranty holder to perform the
work, if applicable. Indoor equipment is preferred. Mechanical equipment rooms must:
– Be provided with a floor drain or floor sink, which must have a trap guard or trap primer

26 30 00 FACILITY ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATING AND
STORING EQUIPMENT
The generator set (genset) will provide emergency power when the grid is down, allowing critical mission
and mission-critical activities to continue. The combination of powering the distribution system and smart
switches to manage loads must allow the genset to power many operations that do not have their own
backup generators and provide redundancy to locations that have backup generators. A dual-fuel genset
also serves as a backup power source if local diesel fuel supplies are compromised for the individual
backup generators, thereby providing multiple layers of resiliency.
Natural disasters that affect the base may also adversely affect the surrounding region. Consequently, the
base may be in competition for the replenishment of diesel fuel for emergency power generation. Adding
diesel storage onsite enhances the base’s ability to continue electric service to critical mission activities in
the face of regional fuel shortages.
26 31 00 Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Components
PV will provide emergency electric power when the grid is down, allowing critical mission and missioncritical
activities to continue for an extended period. The combination of PV and battery energy storage
systems provide further resiliency and redundancy to the electrical power supply.
26 32 13.13 Diesel-Engine-Driven Generator Sets
In addition to submittals listed in the UFGS document, if the genset uses compressed air for starting, the
design data for the compressed air starting system must be submitted.
The power rating of the genset will generally be in accordance with NFPA 110 as Level 2, Class 4,
Type 120. Gensets used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be rated as Prime power.
The genset application designation for units used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be
designated as “parallel with other generators on an isolated bus.” The genset application designation for
units used to power individual facilities must be designated as “stand-alone.”
All generator cooling systems must be closed-loop systems and must use air as the final heat sink.
The genset enclosure for outdoor installation must be stainless-steel or marine-grade aluminum for a
marine environment, including wind-blown brackish water. Louvers must be hurricane shutters designed
per wind requirements. Sound attenuation must result in sound levels not to exceed 85 A-weighted
decibels (dBA) at 10 feet from surface of enclosure. The preferred muffler location is inside the enclosure.
Alternatively, the engine-generator set must be enclosed in a structure similar to that described in Naval

Fuel consumption limitations and testing as described in UFGS 26 32 15.00 10 paragraphs 2.1.10,
2.1.11, and 3.6.11 are not applicable. The genset supplier must submit fuel consumption data for 50%,
75%, and 100% of rated output capacity.
The genset design should include a day tank sized for a minimum of 4 hours of operation at full load
without refilling. The unit should also have a main storage tank sized for 7 days of operation at full load
without refilling. An auxiliary pump must be included to transfer fuel from the main storage tank to the
day tank.
Lightning protection for this equipment must adhere to the recommendations and requirements of the
following standards:

• UFC 3-575-01, Lightning and Static Electricity Protection Systems
26 32 13.19 Dual-Fuel-Engine-Driven Generator Sets (Stationary) 2 MW
In general, the duel-fuel genset should adhere to the requirements of UFC 3-540-01, Engine-driven
Generator Systems for Prime and Standby Power Applications, and UFGS 26 32 15.00 10, Diesel-
Generator Set Stationary 100-2500 kW, with Auxiliaries, including the guidelines for UFGS 26 32 15.00
10. This genset is intended to be connected to the Tyndall AFB distribution grid and operate in island
mode or isolated in parallel with other generators on the Tyndall AFB distribution grid.
The unit will be expected to operate on Jet A, instead of diesel fuel, of the same specifications as
delivered to Tyndall AFB for aviation use but with provision for adding any chemicals necessary to meet
the engine manufacturer’s minimum fuel specifications regarding lubricity for equipment wear, especially
the engine fuel pump. The chemical addition unit should be designed to add the chemicals as fuel is
transferred from the genset’s main fuel storage tank to the day tank. In addition, the genset must be able
to operate on a mixture of natural gas and Jet A, with a minimum of 30% natural gas in the mixture. The
genset must be able to shift from 100% liquid fuel to the natural gas/liquid mixture and back without
losing power.
Operational classification of the genset will generally be in accordance with NFPA 110 as Level 2,
Class 4, Type 120. Gensets that will be used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be rated
as prime power. The genset application designation for units used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution
system must be considered to be “parallel with other generators on an isolated bus.”
Fuel consumption limitations and testing as described in UFGS 26 32 15.00 10 paragraphs 2.1.10,
2.1.11, and 3.6.11 are not applicable. Genset supplier must submit fuel consumption data for 50%, 75%,
and 100% of rated output capacity for operating cases of 100% Jet A, 30% natural gas/70% Jet A, 50/50
mixture, and maximum natural gas content allowed mixture.
Depending on the engine manufacturer and the method of mixing the natural gas and liquid fuel, a gas
compressor unit may be required to boost the pipeline gas pressure from a nominal 15 psig to the inlet
pressure required by the engine manufacturer. This unit would consist of a gas compressor (rotary screw
or reciprocating), inlet filter, suction and discharge bottles, and associated controls, all as a skid-mounted
unit. The unit would be protected by an enclosure for outdoor installation, stainless-steel or marine
aluminum, designed for a marine environment, including wind-blown brackish water. Louvers must be
hurricane shutters designed per Miami/Dade County Risk Category 5. Sound attenuation must result in
sound levels not to exceed 85 dBA at 10 feet from the surface of the enclosure. Alternatively, the

27 10 05.1 Communications Entrance Facility
Per the NEC, non-building rated OSP fiber optic cable entering a building must not exceed 50 feet in
cable length from the building entrance.
27 10 05.2 Grounding and Bonding
Comply with NFPA 70 for grounding and bonding requirements. Provide a telecommunications bonding
and grounding system in accordance with TIA-607-C or current version.
Bond all telecommunications racks and supporting metallic structures (cable trays, ladders, conduits, and
baskets). Non-continuous distribution systems (that is, stub-ups and J-hooks) do not require bonding.
27 10 05.6 Communications Termination Blocks and Patch Panels
Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be spliced to the fiber optic cable and dressed into the back side of the
fiber optic distribution panel (FODP) and splice assembly.
Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be factory-made pigtail fiber optic cable assemblies with one end blunt
(splice end) and the other end with factory terminated connectors.
Fiber optic pigtail assemblies must be sized based on actual installation length requirements of each
installation.
DIVISION 27 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 187

characteristics as the installed cable it is spliced to.
FODP must be wall mounted or rack-mounted depending on its location.
FODP must be sized for one to four rack units.
All fiber strands must be dressed into the rear of the FODP and presented on the backside of a highdensity
housing panel.
The dressing-in of fiber strands must follow the fiber optic color code standard ensuring all fiber strands
are kept in a straight-through configuration on both cable ends.
New FODPs must be from the same original equipment manufacturer as reused existing FODPs.
27 10 05.7 Communications Cable Management and Ladder Rack
Do not use ladder cable trays for horizontal distribution due to possible cable deformation with large cable
quantities.
27 10 20 Communications Pathways
For intra-building backbone distribution, provide a minimum of two, 4-inch conduits between
telecommunications racks (TRs) located on the same floor or pathway that provide equivalent capacity
(for example, cable tray installed to support backbone and horizontal distribution).
In multistory buildings, provide a minimum of three, 4-inch conduits, sleeves, or an equivalent-sized slot
between stacked TRs on successive floors in accordance with TIA-569-C.
27 10 20.1 Conduits and Backboxes for Communications Systems
Design conduit systems in accordance with TIA-569-C.
Install EMT conduit from the cable backbone distribution system, whether cable tray or enclosed duct, to
each outlet unless a conduit-less system is approved by the telecommunications manager.
Provide a minimum of 1-inch EMT conduit for standard outlets.
When cable tray or enclosed duct is not used, install individual conduits from the TR to each outlet.
Coordinate conduit bend radii with cable bend radius. Arrange conduit entries at outlet and junction boxes
so cables passing through the box enter and exit at opposite sides of the box.
Do not use flexible metal conduit for telecommunications wiring except when installing floor-access boxes
in a raised floor, where the floor-access box may be relocated within a specified service area. In this case
the length of the flexible metal conduit must not exceed a length of 20 feet (6 meters) for each run per
TIA-569-C.
Avoid using in-slab and below-grade conduit systems for interior telecommunications designs because
these systems provide the least flexible horizontal distribution system. If an in-slab or below-grade conduit
system is used in the telecommunications design, comply with NFPA 70 and use cables listed and rated
for wet locations.
Do not use plenum- or riser-rated cable, gel-filled OSP, and unlisted cables in such an environment.
Consider that cables rated for a wet location typically have a larger outside diameter, and this may affect
conduit fill rates and conduit sizing.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 27
188 04 October 2019
Larger conduit sizing in the slab may affect the structural integrity of the structure. For in-floor conduit
systems, provide home runs back to the TR serving that area. Serve all telecommunications outlets from
the TR located on that floor.
Use an optimal conduit fill ratio of 40% for conduit sizing. Do not exceed a fill ratio of 50%.
Do not install more than four, four-pair cables in a 1-inch conduit.
Place pull and splice boxes in conduit runs in accordance with TIA-569-C.
27 10 20.2 Cable Trays for Communications Systems
The DoD-required horizontal pathway is a ceiling distribution system employing a centralized cable tray
system originating in the telecommunications space and continuing out into the serving areas.
Use cable tray for horizontal distribution to the maximum extent possible (80 to 90% of the horizontal
cable length).
The remaining pathway to the work area outlet may be implemented in a variety of ways combining
conduit, non-continuous cable supports, and stub-ups/outs.
Use solid bottom, slotted bottom, or welded wire cable tray to provide a centralized cable
management/distribution system.
Design cable trays to accommodate an initial calculated fill ratio of 25%.
The maximum fill ratio of any cable tray is 50%. (Note: This allows for future growth within the cable tray.
Due to random placement of cables and space between the cables, a 25% fill ratio means that in reality
the tray is half-filled.)
The maximum fill depth of any cable tray is 6 inches.
Provide and maintain a minimum of 12 inches access headroom above a cable tray system or
cable runway.
27 10 20.4 Hangers and Supports for Communications Systems
The use of J hooks, flexible cable tray(s), and alternative support systems specifically certified for the
cable used is permissible to support cable extensions from the cable tray.
Do not exceed a 50% fill ratio for the J hooks.
Support must be provided for horizontal cabling to distribution areas in cable tray(s).
Non-continuous cable supports are not allowed in the following:
• In place of the cable tray system or as the sole distribution system in place of home-run conduit.
Design non-continuous cable supports to support the category-rating of the cable. Supports must not
exceed 20 cables or 50% of the fill capacity, whichever is less.
• Locations that exceed 50 feet (15 meters) total length through a non-continuous cable support
system.
• In ceilings in which infection control protocol affects ceiling tile removal.
• In areas where the cable must be protected.
When using non-continuous cable supports, provide in accordance with TIA-569-C.

See Division 34, Transportation, for road section requirements.
Long-Life Pavement Design
• Long-life pavement design must be in accordance with a design procedure that is formally
recognized, adopted, and documented by the project owner. In many instances (but not all), this
could be the process described in American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials’ (AASHTO’s) Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, 4th Edition with 1998 Supplement or
the process described in AASHTO’s Mechanistic‐Empirical Pavement Design Guide, Interim Edition:
A Manual of Practice.
• Design at least 75% of the total new or reconstructed pavement surface area for regularly trafficked
lanes of pavement must meet long-life pavement design criteria. This means 75% of the total surface
area of all traveled lanes is designed for long life. Shoulders, medians, sidewalks, and other incidental
paved areas are not included in this calculation.
• Design and specify that 100% of the total new or reconstructed asphalt pavement for regularly
traveled lanes must use materials and technologies to achieve a field construction density of 94% of
the maximum theoretical density. The density at construction must represent the in‐place density after
the asphalt mixture has been compacted with the rollers but prior to opening the roadway to traffic.

it interacts through abiotic and biotic flows and exchanges.
7) Potential threats to the health and integrity of the restored ecosystem from the surrounding landscape
have been eliminated or reduced as much as possible.
8) The restored ecosystem is sufficiently resilient to endure the normal periodic stress events in the local
environment that serve to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem.
9) The restored ecosystem is self-sustaining to the same degree as its reference system and has the
potential to persist indefinitely under existing environmental conditions.
32 80 00 IRRIGATION
Potable water use for irrigation purposes is not allowed per UFC 1-200-02. Rainwater harvesting or other
alternative means is acceptable in some cases as a water source for landscape irrigation.
Where irrigation for a project is to be provided by rainwater collection, coordinate the design with the
building mechanical and plumbing system designs to allow the collection of HVAC condensate and
rainwater from roof drain systems.
In isolated areas of Tyndall AFB where maintaining the quality of domestic water requires periodic
flushing of watermains, the base may consider an irrigation system. The system must be sized to use the
planned volume and frequency of flushing, and no more domestic water than was planned for water
quality maintenance must be used.
32 90 00 PLANTING
Landscape Design Concept
The landscape design must be defined by four zones: Natural Perimeter Zone, Transition Zone,
Maintained Zone, and Flight Line Zone.
Natural Perimeter Zone: This zone encompasses all perimeter areas and large unused areas among
groups of buildings. The zone must have native grasses, shrubs, and trees that are local to the
environment and as recommended by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service recommendations for what is
currently being used on the base in the natural areas.
Transition Zone: The Transition Zone must contain mostly native wire and Indian grasses. It will be
mowed only twice per year when recommend.
Maintained Zone: This zone is located around the immediate perimeter of a building or the center of a
main space , such as the town center. Areas in this zone will have turf grass that will be mowed on a
regular basis to keep a manicured look. The zone should be drought resistant and also contain native
trees for shade and ornamental grasses and native shrubs for color and variety. Ornamental grasses and
shrubs should be located in areas close to building entrances. Design should be simple in nature but bold
in color. All landscaping should be to maintain.
Flight Line Zone: The Flight Line Zone is similar to the Maintained Zone except that tree use should be
limited and not be planted close to the runway. Trees should be placed further back toward the second
row of structures. Trees should be limited to species that do not attract birds.

Xeriscape Design Principles
Minimizing Water Requirements
The base will have limited irrigation except in the Maintained Zone, which might receive water through a
rainwater harvesting system. Use plant species that are native and drought-tolerant. Temporary irrigation
may be used to establish plantings once they are first planted but not after one growing season.
Plant Material Selection
Plant selection must be as specified herein. Contractor/designer has the ability to modify the planting
pallet as long as it is approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife representative on the base. It must be native
and found in the local environment having shown resiliency to drought and establishment in native soils.
Water Budgeting (Hydrozones)
Streetscape Landscaping
Street landscaping must be similar to the zone in which it is planted, most likely in the Transition Zone.
Bioswales should use planting recommended by Florida Fish and Wildlife that is capable of living in
varied conditions of short-term flooding to drought. Major streets should be lined with native trees to
provide shade and direct traffic. Trees must be planted on the land side of sidewalks and not between
sidewalks and curbs.
Parking Lot Landscaping
Parking lots should have native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses arranged in large groups to form a
designed look instead of a native, organic look. For islands with drainage, plants should be able to
withstand the same conditions specified for bioswales. Use trees for shade where appropriate. Do not
plant trees in small island spaces; plant them in the outside perimeter of the parking lot or in islands that
are no less than 10 feet wide.
Screen/Accent Landscaping
Plantings for screening shall must be native and evergreen of medium height.
Drip Irrigation Zones (Special Irrigation)
Drip irrigation will be used in shrub planting areas adjacent to building entrances where special planting
occurs. The water should not be potable and should come from rainwater harvesting.
Temporary Irrigation
Temporary irrigation will be used by the contractor to establish all plantings for one growing season as
part of their contract. After one season, planting must be weaned off water over a 6 month period to allow
plants to acclimate to local conditions.
32 93 00 Plants
Conserve and use appropriate plants.
Native and adapted non-invasive plans help to maintain ecosystem service, increase biodiversity, provide
wildlife habitat, and require minimum maintenance. Projects must remove invasive species found onsite,
conserve existing appropriate plants, and only use appropriate plants for installation.
• Conduct an assessment that shows existing vegetated area and distinguishes which plants are
existing native species.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 32
204 04 October 2019
• Conserve existing native and adapted non-invasive plants onsite. If removal of existing native and
adapted non-invasive plants occurs, install new appropriate plants to equal 100% of final site
vegetated area.
– New native plant calculations are measured by surface area of final vegetated area, using
estimated vegetated cover within 10 years of installation.
• Appropriate plant species are species suitable for site conditions, climate, and design intent. Both
native and non-native plants may qualify. The list below shows invasive species as designed by
Federal or qualifying regional lists:
– State or local lists (when listing occurs through a vetted, transparent process and has been
accepted by regional stakeholders)
– The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS Database
– Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States website
– State and Federal Noxious Weed laws
• Potable water for landscaping irrigation is prohibited on the base. All plant materials must require no
permanent irrigation after establishment period, unless greywater or harvested rainwater is used for
irrigation.
32 94 00 Planting Accessories
Tree Grates
Grates should be used sparingly. Trees will do better if planted
in grass or other soft areas instead of paved areas. The grate
must be aluminum and also must have a powder coat finish to
resist rusting.

modifications are made or updated information about the water supply is available from Bay County. The
model must be used to predict areas that may experience low residual chlorine levels (an indicator of
possible low water quality). Testing stations must be installed to monitor chlorine residual levels in these
areas and report results via the SCADA system to the UOC.

The system must be configured as a self-healing topology to the extent possible with engineering access
to the protection and control systems to maximize uptime, increase safety, reliability, efficiency, and
capacity for base improvements.
The SCADA system must be operated from the UOC, which will be located in a new building near the
Base Emergency Operations Center (EOC) facility. The UOC must be watched for normal operations
24/7, and when a base emergency is declared, additional staff will report to the base EOC and interface
with the emergency management team at the remote UOC workstation.
The UOC should not be confused with a National Operations Center, Regional Operations Center, or the
overall base EOC.
The following design criteria apply to the utilities SCADA system and its associated UOC control room:

• Develop a Monitoring and Management Plan to compare estimated savings to actual performance.
33 12 00 Surface Water Sources
Tyndall AFB is located in the St. Andrew Bay Watershed. To address watershed-level sustainability and
resiliency, water utility project teams must evaluate impacts to the watershed and reduce net negative
impacts on fresh water availability and quantity, and also identify measures for making positive
contributions to watershed protection. The St. Andrew Bay Watershed Surface Water Improvement and
Management (SWIM) plan describes watershed resources and issues and provides a comprehensive,
basin-wide management strategy as the regional guiding framework.
Water utility project teams must work with the S+R Coordinator (as required in Division 01) and the SWIM
plan framework to address and provide documentation for the following:
• Assess the project’s watershed context and the watershed-scale fresh water issues, including
location, type, quantity, rate of recharge, and quality of water resources, as well as source and
impacts of water used and the destination and impacts of wastewater.

33 40 00 Stormwater Conveyance
Where not financially impractical or waived by the base, all conveyance systems must be designed to
maintain the hydraulic gradeline calculated for the 25-year design storm below ground level in piping
systems. For areas drained by open channels, culverts, and connected detention/retention areas at no
time should stormwater flows overtop a roadway.
33 44 43 Vortex-Type Hydrodynamic Separators
Where large areas of pavement are likely to generate large quantities of suspended solids in runoff or
where a greater-than-normal possibility of oils or other pollutants is present, a Manufactured Treatment
Device must be installed. This must function as a pretreatment of stormwater upstream of entering
landscaped or infiltration-based water quality systems or other detention/retention facilities. The units
selected must adhere to the following requirements:
• Be certified for 80% total suspended solids removal by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection or the State of Washington Department of Ecology
• Provide storage for oil and other floatable contaminants
• Be of a general design that allows ease of maintenance under the existing contract for similar work on
base

testing documentation showing compliance with the above requirements and similar testing methods
required to earn the certifications.
33 46 00 Stormwater Management
All stormwater management facilities must be designed and constructed to accomplish the water quality
requirements of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Northwest Florida Water
Management District.
Project teams must exceed UFC 3-210-10 for Low Impact Development through designs that manage
stormwater runoff to meet the following performance requirements:
• 100% of 95th percentile local 24-hour event is infiltrated, evapotranspirated, or reused onsite
• If infiltration, evapotranspiration, or reuse are not permitted, infeasible, or impracticable then detain
and treat 150% of 95th percentile 24-hour event
• Rate or quantity of runoff for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year 24-hour rainfall event relative to the
existing condition (greenfield, greyfield, or brownfield) cannot be exceeded
• For treatment of any precipitation volume not retained the treatment practices implemented must
achieve, at a minimum, an average discharge concentration of less than or equal to 25 mg/L total
suspended solids for the volume treated
• In cases where receiving waters are impaired or threatened by specific pollutants of concern,
treatment must be provided for these pollutants
Project teams must evaluate and use as appropriate the following stormwater management design
strategies:
• Design to minimize impervious surfaces; when and where possible specify permeable materials for
hard surfaces, including permeable concrete, asphalt, and pavers.
• Design hard surfaces to drain into localized, onsite landscape areas, and design landscape areas to
accept precipitation runoff from hard surfaces.
IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft DIVISION 33
214 04 October 2019
• Provide infiltration opportunities in the landscape that use plants and healthy soils as filters, such as
bioswales, raingardens, water quality ponds, constructed wetlands, or vegetated buffers, that filter,
infiltrate, evapotranspirate, and retain precipitation, recharge groundwater, and reduce pollutant
loadings, runoff volumes, and rates.
• Where runoff conveyance systems are needed, use vegetated channels when possible. Where
vegetated channels are not practical, the use of hard, non-erosive materials to convey surface water
should take precedence over using pipes, culverts, or underground channels.
• Create living landscapes using soil and vegetation features, such as vegetated roofs, walls, or
facades; raingardens; or tree canopies.
• Select appropriate vegetation features that can tolerate periodic inundation and soil saturation without
harming the growth or vigor of the plant.
• When selecting vegetation for managing precipitation runoff, select plants resistant or less
susceptible to pollutants commonly found in precipitation runoff.
• Where possible, select plants appropriate for the site and climate based on their capacity to reduce
pollutant loadings for specific pollutants of concern in the receiving watershed.
• Improve the water-retention capacity of the soil by increasing the organic matter content of the soil
through the addition of compost or other organic soil amendments.
• Use rainwater-harvesting systems to reduce precipitation runoff volumes and rates. Design rainwater
harvesting and use systems to maintain the ecological flows of receiving waters and historical
groundwater recharge rates.
• Avoid or minimize the use of materials used in buildings, hardscape, and landscape construction that
can be a source of pollutants in stormwater, such as, copper and zinc roofs, roof gutters, downspouts,
and siding, galvanized materials (for example, fences, fence posts, guardrails, signposts), and treated
lumber.
• Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices to control pests.
• Minimize the use of fertilizers onsite, and implement practices to reduce nutrient runoff (for example,
slow-release fertilizers, optimized application timing for plant uptake).
• Where appropriate, implement systems of practices in a treatment train to provide multiple pollutant
removal processes (for example, runoff reduction through evapotranspiration and infiltration,
sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, biological degradation, or uptake) to reduce the concentrations of
pollutants in precipitation runoff and to provide redundancy in the system.
• Use soil and vegetation-based controls based on their capacity to reduce precipitation runoff and
pollutant loadings through evapotranspiration and phytoremediation.
Project teams must provide the S+R Coordinator with the following onsite stormwater management
documentation:
• Site plan and a detailed description of all stormwater management strategies in the project and their
function and performance features in infiltrating, evapotranspirating, reusing, or treating to the
specified requirements above
• Detailed treatment plans including volumetric capacity and removal efficiency for target pollutants
including suspended solids, metals (zinc, copper, lead, and other heavy metals) and contaminants
(nitrogen, phosphorous, fecal coliform, and petroleum hydrocarbons)
• SWPPP for all construction activities; refer to 01 57 23 for SWPPP information and requirements

33 46 23 Modular Buried Stormwater Storage Units
Where base development plans limit the space available for above-ground storage facilities for
stormwater management underground structured systems may be used. Structures may be cast in place
concrete vaults, manufactured modular units made of concrete or HDPE, or pipes. All systems must be
designed to manage the runoff from the appropriate design storm, support a H-20 loading at a minimum
(a higher loading requirement may be required by the base dependent on the expected uses of the
associated facility), water quality management is provided by use of a pretreatment system or an open
bottom system which allows infiltration is selected.
33 70 00 ELECTRICAL UTILITIES
The resiliency and sustainability of electric power will be enhanced by implementing high speed switching
and protective capabilities to the transmission and distribution systems. Such devices allow electric power
to follow alternative paths during emergency conditions.
33 71 00 Electrical Utility Transmission and Distribution
All electrical distribution must be installed underground. At a minimum, underground distribution must be

equipped with a microprocessor-based protective relay. The relay must be capable of opening or closing
both the switched ways and protected ways. The relay must operate the protected ways under fault
conditions. The relay must be wired for switch status, protected way status, and fault indicator status. The
relay must be capable of SCADA communications using IEEE 61850 over fiber. Each switchgear must be
arranged in a loop configuration with switched ways connecting to other switches or the substation and
protected ways feeding buildings or other loads looped back to another switchgear protected way with a
normally open point in the center of that loop. Each normally open point will be approximately splitting the
loop load in half. If a fault develops between any two switches, the substation will operate, isolating that
loop. The two switches closest to the fault will open, the normally open point will close, refeeding the
system once the substation recloses that feeder. For a fault on the protected ways, the relays must open
the protected ways closest to the fault and close the normally open point refeeding the loads. The SCADA
system must be capable of operating each switch or protected way for load shedding of non-critical loads
under utility failures.

DIVISION 34 TRANSPORTATION
The Transportation System is designed to provide system protection and facilitate continuous operations.
This is achieved through minimal use of traffic signal systems. Instead, roundabouts must provide access
control at arterial intersections. Safety and access are improved through the use of sidewalks and shareduse
paths for people walking or riding bikes. Life-cycle impacts of the transportation system are reduced
for new construction through the use of hardened pavements for vehicular roadways and the use of
recycled asphalt for the shared-use paths. Roadway lighting used must be controlled and controllable to
power down when not needed to save energy and power up in case of emergency.
34 70 00 TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT
34 71 00 Roadway Construction
The hierarchy of streets must be based on the master road network plan. Technical information for the
design standards must be provided by the Geotechnical Team. The network consists of the three road
types:
1) Heavy Haul Road
2) Arterial Street
3) Shared Use Path
The arterial street and heavy haul road must include travel lanes, at-grade 2-foot “ribbon” concrete curb,
buffer (which is some cases may include bioretention swales), shared-use path, or sidewalk, and utility
corridor. The primary difference between an arterial street and a heavy haul road is the pavement
materials and depth. The heavy haul street must have pavement designed to withstand heavy truck traffic
(AASHTO H25/HS25). The shared-use path must use reclaimed asphalt from the site.
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
See Division 25, Integrated Automation.
Curb And Gutter
Roadways must incorporate at-grade 2-foot “ribbon” concrete curb to allow for water to flow from street to
bioretention swale.
Street Lighting
See Division 26, Electrical.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
In addition to UFC standards, design of pedestrian facilities, shared use paths, and bicycle facilities must
refer to Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Design Manuals 222 – Pedestrian Facilities, 223 –
Bicycle Facilities, and 224 – Shared Use Paths, as well as Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
Streets and Highways (MUTCD) or AASHTO Guidelines for Bicycle Facilities, whichever is more stringent
for design of paths including pavement marking and signage.
Intersection Configuration
Intersection configuration must encourage passive systems such as roundabouts in lieu of signalized
intersections. Aggressively pursue passive systems to lower maintenance requirements and reduce
energy use. Design traffic signal mast arms and related traffic control devices (such as traffic signal

• Apply a waterproof coating to exterior walls and seal all wall penetrations, including windows, doors,
and locations where utilities enter the building.
DIVISION 35 IFS Design Guide Appendix | Rough Draft
04 October 2019 221
• Seal every utility, including electrical and telecommunications conduits, sanitary sewer and
stormwater infrastructure, to prevent infiltration during a storm surge event.
• Consider the need to install backflow prevention devices, duckbills, or tidal check valves in
stormwater infrastructure to prevent tidal and surge flooding of stormwater infrastructure. This should
be paired with a high onsite precipitation capture given the potential for backup or overflow during
high precipitation events.
• Increase the durability of structures: Strengthen foundations, floor slabs, and walls to resist
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and buoyant forces.
• Use building and structural materials resistant to saltwater, flooding, heat, cold, wind, and UV light,
but environmentally safe.
• Free the areas below the lowest floor of elevated buildings of obstructions or ensure that any
enclosed areas constructed of non-supporting breakaway walls, open lattice-work, or screening will
not cause building collapse, displacement, or other damage to the building foundation if impacted by
or lost due to wave forcing in areas within or near the current limits of moderate wave action (LiMVA),
which includes FEMA A and V zones.
• Develop, where appropriate, landscape-scale storm-surge and wave damage risk reduction features,
including upland strategies that reduce the impacts of flooding and waves on vulnerable assets, such
as vegetated upland berms connected with high elevation points, floodwalls integrated into the
landscape, raising edge elevation, or other landscape features.
• Employ nature-based features as feasible to reduce wave damage from smaller, more frequent
storms, including wetland, mangrove, coastal shrubland, and edge forest.
• Use shoreline edge materials for stabilization that have a chemical composition, alkalinity, toxicity,
pH, and other features that support the native biological community and attachment of characteristic
marine organisms.
• Design and enhance structural features to provide more heterogeneity and habitat-supporting
complexity than conventional stabilization methods by using rough, textured, surfaces or varied sizes
of rock that create interstitial spaces of varied size and shape, using a material with a pH that fosters
attachment or provides refugia for native aquatic organisms.
• Use water-retaining ecological features to increase diversity of habitat and maintain some intertidal
zonation, such as precast tide pools.
• Incorporate nature-based features that provide multiple benefits, such as tiered, reinforced edges with
native plantings, oysters, mussels, and salt marsh.
• Incorporate temporary stabilization strategies for wave attenuation and erosion reduction until
vegetation is established.
35 31 00 Shoreline Protection
All design activities related to Shoreline Protection must be conducted in collaboration with USFWS within
the guidelines of the Tyndall AFB INRMP. Project teams must assess and develop opportunities for
integrating Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) in all Shoreline Protection designs. Examples of
NNBF include beaches and dunes; vegetated environments such as maritime forests, salt marshes,
freshwater wetlands and fluvial flood plains, and seagrass beds; coral and oyster reefs; and barrier
islands, among others. These features may occur naturally in landscapes or be engineered, constructed,
and/or restored to mimic natural conditions. For more information see the USACE Engineering With
